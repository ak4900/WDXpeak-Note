Hi, everyone. I'm going to introduce one of my favorite projects, I call it WKK, in about 10 minutes.

This is a local machine tool that help me collect valuable information from specific web sources, manage all my notes and turn them into knowledge.

The quick development of computer and Internet bring us a brand new life style. After several years of "smart" life, I feel frustrated to find out that I'm trapped in a digital castle which has lots of beautiful rooms. The rooms are so beautiful that most of the time I don't want to leave. But if one day I lose my smart phone or my computer breaks down, the great castle disappears and life becomes really tough.

On one hand, my castle is my home that makes me feel comfortable. But on the other hand, the castle is my prison which keeps me inside. The longer I have lived there, the harder I can get rid of it.

In my opinion, instead of becoming a beautiful castle that lock me down, those smart devices should be the tools that help me lead a life with more choices and opportunities. As it is, I make this tool to give myself more freedom to be who I am. It is the tool that learns to suit me, not I learn to use the tool.

With the help of WKK, I want to connect all my digital devices with ease and find the relations between all my notes as well as ebooks. It is a magic box that mix books, news, websites and notes together and organize them in a natural way so that I can search and unify them easily. This is the process of building my framework of knowledge.

WKK is the main digital tool for minimalism life. I used to use the following applications to take notes, record my ideas and arrange my ebooks:

+ Evernote: Collect notes from Internet and wechat
+ Wunderlist: GTD tool
+ Calibre: ebook management

But these days I have so many digital devices:

+ Android Phone
+ iPhone
+ Windows Phone
+ iPad
+ Kindle
+ Windows Notebook
+ Macbook

It is so difficult to find a tool that can connect those different platforms together with user-friendly applications. A more common situation is that some of them work well on some platform but different platforms have their own logics which make things complex.

What's more, with the mentioned applications, different kinds of data are separate. They are not connected! If notes are not connected, how can I extract the relations between them. If there's no relations, how can I turn them into knowledge?

So what do I need?

+ A directory-based markdown(plain text) note system
    + I can take notes, write blogs, etc
    + Don't need to install anything to use the basic function. A portable disk can be my whole knowledge base
+ All platforms covered import and export toolkit
    + I can easily continue my work in different devices and situations
    + Easily integrated with cloud service such as Github and Dropbox
+ Automatic Information Crawler
    + Given specific topic, find related books and news
    + Concept definition from wiki
+ Relation Finder
    + Find similar notes or web information
    + Extract Keywords
    + Logic Combiner among different topics

This is why I make WKK.The main focus of WKK is Minimalism. It is a different life style from what I lead now.

Minimalism is a tool that can assist you in finding freedom. Freedom from fear. Freedom from worry. Freedom from overwhelm. Freedom from guilt. Freedom from depression. Freedom from the trappings of the consumer culture we’ve built our lives around. Real freedom.

When I know minimalism, it seems that what I have been pursuing for such a long time finally got an answer. So I want to make WKK in a minimalism way.

So I want to make WKK as simple and elegant as possible, the less dependency the better. In that case, I can put more energy to those things that really matters.

Minimalism has helped us:

+ Eliminate our discontent
+ Reclaim our time
+ Live in the moment
+ Pursue our passions
+ Discover our missions
+ Experience real freedom
+ Create more, consume less
+ Focus on our health
+ Grow as individuals
+ Contribute beyond ourselves
+ Rid ourselves of excess stuff
+ Discover purpose in our lives

Besides minimalism. There are another six keywords for WKK:

Personal, Smart, Automatic, Efficient, Sharing, Creating

Personal: Except for the common language database from the internet, all the training data is my notes, my reading as well as my notes. As it is, WKK will be a very personal toolkit that knows your language pattern and favorite topics.

Smart: The best part of WKK is that the longer I use it, the better it understands me. With the help of researches on big data, it can give me useful recommendations related to the topics and themes I'm interested in.

Automatic: Tools are the helper that do most of the dirty work for human. So is WKK. Most of the features can work automatically as if it doesn't exist. I can just use it in a natural way. The only thing I need to do is focusing on learning and thinking. The rest will be handled by WKK automatically.

Efficient: There are so much information every moment everyday: Mail, News, Twitter, Facebook, Weibo, Wechat, etc. WKK helps me to gather all the information together and gives me a daily report so that I don't need to waste so much time on filtering information. WKK did it for me.

Sharing: It's so easy to share my notes or knowledge with others with the help of WKK. Here is the supported formats: html, epub, mobi, azw3, pdf, jpg, email, etc.
Creating: With the knowledge graph generated by WKK. I can find related topics and themes easily. With new connections, new thoughts and ideas can always be available in my brain.

Here is the philosophy of WKK, also the philosophy of minimalism in my mind.

I hope you can figure out what I'm working on right now. For more detail you can visit the project website on github.

Peace out.
