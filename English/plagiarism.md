# Avoid Plagiarism

+ Principle 1: **Unless you are quoting, the language must be yours**. If you use the original source's IDEAS, you must USE YOUR OWN WORDS and you must acknowledge the source and cite it correctly. Crediting a source but using the source's words without quotation is still plagiarism.
+ Principle 2: **When you are quoting, you must get the quotes right**. If you use the original source's WORDS, you must put the source's words in quotes, acknowledge the source, and cite it correctly. Quoting words that don't actually belong to the source is misrepresentation, considered another form of plagiarism.
+ Principle 3: **When you cite other people, you must get the spirit of their meaning right as well as the letter**. Citing or quoting an author out of context is another form of misrepresentation, considered plagiaristic.
