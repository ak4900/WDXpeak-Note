# Revision 3

## Analysis

### Situation, Audience and Purpose

Your company wants to use this handbook to help your employees[^1] to get familiar with the regulations[^2] as soon as possible, including workplace environment, sexual harassment and discrimination, ending employment, salary issues as well as PTO problem.

### Most Stylistic Problems and Principles

In my opinion, the most stylistic problems is fat and elegance. Fat is using the same words over and over again. Elegance is the balance, symmetry of information chunks. Artful repetition of grammatical chunks so that readers can store multiple chunks of the sentence as if they were one. End with heaviness. Designed to enhance the memoriability of speech.

This handbook gives me such an impression that the employees are the enemy of the company. I don't think people can read it with ease and pleasure.

### Examples

In section 1, many paragraphs start with "DAM". However, as it is the handbook for employees of the company, it's better to use "We" instead of "DAM". I think it can show that the company is willing to offer help to those employees with drug and alcoholic problem.

Another example is that the handbook repeats the same thing several times(the 1st and 4th paragraph) which makes it long and confusing.

## Revised

I'll choose SECTION 4 & SECTION 5 as most of the problems are the same in the other sections.

### SECTION 4: “Pay at Separation from or Termination of Employment”

Upon separation from, or termination of, employment, We[^3] will determine the total amount of the following debts[^4]:

+ outstanding debt
+ non-returned items feeds
+ advance PTO
+ advance Sick Days
+ any other outstanding debt owed to the Company

In accordance with the law, once a full accounting is made, a final paycheck for any balance due will be issued on the next regular pay day following your last day of work[^5].

You will be invoiced and the total balance owed will be due not later than 30 days from the date of the invoice if the final accounting of your final paycheck indicates a balance due from you to us[^6]. Direct Advantage Marketing reserves the right to pursue collection activities for any outstanding balance to the fullest extent allowed by law.

During the process[^7], you may schedule an appointment to meet with a member of the Accounting staff and/or the Office and Benefits Manager so that they may provide you with information about the status of your benefits as well as the final accounting details of your final paycheck. The employee will receive notices of conversion and benefits continuation rights as required by COBRA legislation. Refer to Section 3 – Employee Benefits to learn more about your benefits continuation rights.

### SECTION 5: “How PTO and the Various Forms of Leave Interact”

If illness or injury requires that you miss more than three days of work, here is the priority of different type[^8]:

1. Sick Days(provided you are eligible for Sick Days)
2. Paid Time Off (PTO)
3. Unpaid Leave.

If you are eligible for Short- or Long-Term Disability coverage, you may apply for that coverage but all accrued PTO must be exhausted before that coverage will apply. Absences of less than three days from scheduled work will automatically utilize your accrued PTO unless prior approval was obtained for another category of Leave of Absence. Approved paid Leaves (e.g. Bereavement Leave and Leave for Jury Duty) do not require that PTO be used first, but PTO may be used to supplement these approved Leaves of Absence, subject to a Director’s approval.

All accrued, awarded, or “voucher” PTO (and, in the case of Leave for medical reasons, accrued Sick Days) must be exhausted before any other form of Leave can take effect (except Leave for Jury Duty and Bereavement Leave). PTO and/or Sick Days do not add to the specific Leave duration. Accrued, awarded, or “voucher” PTO (plus accrued Sick Days in the case of Leave for medical reasons) are concurrent with any other type of Leave and accrued, awarded, or begins and do not add to the length of the Leave. Only accrued, awarded, or “voucher” PTO (and accrued Sick Days if applicable) can be used.[^9]

Employees do not accrue PTO or Sick Days while on any Leave (except the portion of the absence that utilizes accrued PTO and/or accrued Sick Days).[^10]

The Senior Director of Human Resources may approve an advancement of un-accrued PTO with a Director’s recommendation. But the total amount of PTO advanced (accrued to date plus advance) cannot exceed the limitation[^11] for that calendar year.

In the event that an employee does not return from an absence[^12], the advance un-accrued PTO plus any advance un-accrued Sick Days taken will be deducted from any pay or bonus[^13]. In the case that the value of off-work[^14] days exceeds any amount owed to them by DAM, the employee will be billed for that amount and every legal action will be taken to secure the repayment of the advance un-accrued PTO and/or Sick Days.[^15]
