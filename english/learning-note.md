# Style 笔记

## Chapter One Understanding Style

+ The mission is to learn 'principles' and not 'rules'.
+ The point is to learn how to revise previously drafted sentences more quickly.
+ Writing represents a 'social event' that involves both a writer and reader.
+ The more clearly we write, the more clearly we see and feel and think. Rules help no one do that, but some principles do.

## Chapter Two Correctness

+ Three kinds of rules
    * Real Rules: Articles must proceed nouns.
    * Social Rules: Standard English from nonstandard English.
    * Invented Rules: 'grammar police' rules
+ Elegant Options
    * Don't split infinitives.
    * Use whom as the object of a verb or preposition.
    * Don't end a sentence with a preposition.
    * Use the singular with none or any.

## Chapter Three Actions

+ Principle of Clarity
    * Make Main Characters Subjects.
    * Make Important Actions Verbs.
+ Nominalizations
    * Nouns 'derived from a verb or adjective'.
    * A sentence seems clear when its important actions are in verbs.
    * When you match characters to subjects and actions to verbs in most of your sentences, readers are likely to think your prose is clear, direct, and readable.
+ Important Points
    * Most sentences tell stories.
    * You should be able to identify the 'character as a subject and a verb as a specific action' in the 'first seven or eight words of every sentence'
    * You can write longer sentences that are also clear so long as the 'major characters' are 'aligned' with 'subjects' and 'actions with verbs'

## Chapter Four Characters

+ Readers want actions in verbs, but even more they want characters as subjects.
+ Search each sentence for the 'characters' and the 'actions'
+ Abstractions as characters can cause confusion
+ When you must use abstractions as characters, 'avoid using lots of other nominalizations around them'
+ You should try to insert a 'general term for who is doing the action'.
+ You should often write in an 'active voice' instead of a 'passive voice'.
+ Active voice can help hte reader 'move more smoothly' through the prose.
+ There are times when you need to write in a passive voice:
    * You don't know who did an action, readers don't care, or you don't want them to know.
    * You want to shift a long and complex bundle of information to the end of its sentence..
    * You want to focus your readers' attention on one or another character.
