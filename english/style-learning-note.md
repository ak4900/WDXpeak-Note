# Style 笔记

Principle - Key Associations

+ Character - Subjects as Agents, Story Characters
+ Action - Averbs that Advance the Plot, Active Verbs in the Main Verb slot; Changing Nominalizaitions to Verbs to Foreground Action
+ Cohesion - Connections between sentences
    * Loose Cohesion - Connections are anywhere
    * Tight Cohesion - Connections between end of sentence 1 and beginning of sentence 2. Minimal requirement of 'flow' as proximity
+ Coherence - Management of Topics so that multiple sentences develop one idea
    * Loose Coherence - Topics(beginnings) persist across sentences. Topic structure analysis chart can be used to chekc for loose coherence.
    * Tight Coherence - Commentary(ends of sentences) develop along some structured plan of development. There are both formal and material plans of development. Formal plans include names like parallel(same as loose coherence), chaining(same as tight cohesion), split comment, hypertopic, and hypercomment. Material plans include names like problem-solution, cause-effect, comparison-contrast, narrative, process, description, illustration/examples, classification. Material plans are sometimes called 'modes' of discourse.
+ Emphasis
    * From flow as proximity to flow as progression. Management of the flow of old and new information within and across sentences. Old information is simple, familiar, and short; new information is complex, unfamiliar and long. Old information comes at the beginning. New information comes at the end. The most important new information is called the stressed element. Devices like passives, There, what-shift, it-shift, and 'not only...but also' can help give you pinpoint precision where the stress lies if you don't want to rely on default placement alone. You really need to think about emphasis as establishing the right conditions for tight coherence.
+ Concision - Wordiness, verbosity, fat. Minimalism. Don't say more than you need to say. Minimalism without terseness. Don't cut to the bone and gristle if your reader expects and requires more helt.
+ Shape - Begin with your point(typically a main verb or main-verb-object) that establishes the 'frame' of your sentence. Once your frame is established, you can add information to the right and your readers will have plenty of working memory to handle it. Get to the verb quickly. Don't tack on subordinate clauses after the ver. Don't interrupt the SVO structure. Don't put a long of filler between the subject and verb or between the verb and object. When sentences are long and complex, break them into individual information chunks and order them chronologically. Keep the architecure of a long sentence sturdy through resumptive, summative, and free modifiers.
+ Elegance - Balance, symmetry of information chunks. Artful repetition of grammatical chunks so that readers can store multiple chunks of the sentence as if they were one. End with heaviness. Designed to enhance the memoriability of speech



## Chapter One Understanding Style

+ The mission is to learn 'principles' and not 'rules'.
+ The point is to learn how to revise previously drafted sentences more quickly.
+ Writing represents a 'social event' that involves both a writer and reader.
+ The more clearly we write, the more clearly we see and feel and think. Rules help no one do that, but some principles do.

## Chapter Two Correctness

+ Three kinds of rules
    * Real Rules: Articles must proceed nouns.
    * Social Rules: Standard English from nonstandard English.
    * Invented Rules: 'grammar police' rules
+ Elegant Options
    * Don't split infinitives.
    * Use whom as the object of a verb or preposition.
    * Don't end a sentence with a preposition.
    * Use the singular with none or any.

## Chapter Three Actions

+ Principle of Clarity
    * Make Main Characters Subjects.
    * Make Important Actions Verbs.
+ Nominalizations
    * Nouns 'derived from a verb or adjective'.
    * A sentence seems clear when its important actions are in verbs.
    * When you match characters to subjects and actions to verbs in most of your sentences, readers are likely to think your prose is clear, direct, and readable.
+ Important Points
    * Most sentences tell stories.
    * You should be able to identify the 'character as a subject and a verb as a specific action' in the 'first seven or eight words of every sentence'
    * You can write longer sentences that are also clear so long as the 'major characters' are 'aligned' with 'subjects' and 'actions with verbs'

## Chapter Four Characters

+ Readers want actions in verbs, but even more they want characters as subjects.
+ Search each sentence for the 'characters' and the 'actions'
+ Abstractions as characters can cause confusion
+ When you must use abstractions as characters, 'avoid using lots of other nominalizations around them'
+ You should try to insert a 'general term for who is doing the action'.
+ You should often write in an 'active voice' instead of a 'passive voice'.
+ Active voice can help hte reader 'move more smoothly' through the prose.
+ There are times when you need to write in a passive voice:
    * You don't know who did an action, readers don't care, or you don't want them to know.
    * You want to shift a long and complex bundle of information to the end of its sentence..
    * You want to focus your readers' attention on one or another character.
