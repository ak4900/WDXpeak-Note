## 句子

+ Like the world `clear`, the words `choppy`, `disorganized` and `connected` refer not to the words on the page but to how they make us feel.
+ We judge sequences of sentences to be `cohesive` depending on how each sentence ends and the next begins.
+ We judge a whole passage to be `coherent` depending on how all the sentences in a passage cumulatively begin.
+ Think of `cohesion` as pairs of sentences fitting together in the way two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle do.
+ Think of `coherence` as seeing what all the sentences in a piece of writing add up to, the way all the pieces in a puzzle add up to the picture on the box.
+ When you start to read a passage whose ideas you expect to be difficult, skim it quickly to find its main characters. Then think about those characters before you begin reading carefully. What do you know about them? What other ideas do you associate with them? What would you expect to read about them? The more sharply you have characters in mind as you read, the more easily you will understand stories about them.
+ When you start to draft a new section of your paper, list the characters you intend to write about. Include not just flesh-and-blood characters, but important concepts as well. Before you draft, think about each character for a moment. Try to picture the people or things on your list. What are they like? For a concept, think about the ideas you associate with it. Then as you draft, try to put those characters into the subjects of most of your sentences. If you do not mention one of those characters for several sentences, you may have gotten off track.
+ Before you begin writing, name the things you are writing about. Those are your `topics`. They should be short, concrete, familiar words, and  more often than not, they should name the main characters in your story. Most of your subjects should be topics. Most important, be consistent: do not vary your subjects for the sake of variety. Your topics should tell your readers what a passage is globally 'about'.

## 技巧

**Sentences are `cohesive` when the last few words of one set up information that appears in the first few words of the next. That's what gives us our experience of flow. And in fact, that's the biggest reason the passive is in the language: to let us arrange sentences so that they flow from one to the next easily.**

### Diagnosis and Revision: Old Before New

Begin sentences with information familiar to your readers.

End sentences with information that readers cannot anticipate.

### Three main principles of clarity

+ Make main characters the subjects of sentences.
+ Make important actions verbs.
+ Put old information before new information.

### Diagnosis and Revision: Topics

1. Diagnose
    + Underline the first seven or eight words of every sentence in a passage, stopping when you hit a verb.
    + If you can, underline the first five or six words of every clause in those sentences.
2. Analyze
    + Do the underlined words constitute a relatively small set of related ideas? Even if you see how they are related, will your readers?
    + Do the underlined words name the most important characters, real or abstract?
3. Rewrite
    + In most of your sentences, use subjects to name their topics.
    + Be sure that those topics are, in context, familiar to your readers.

## 总结

1. Begin sentences with subjects that communicate old information, information that your readers are familiar with; give new, unfamiliar information toward the ends of sentences.
2. Through a series of sentences, keep your topics short and reasonably consistent
