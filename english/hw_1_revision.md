# Revision_Da Wang, Feb. 10 2015_Dear Customers:Because of the increasing cost of natural gas, we make a difficult decision to file a request with the Pennsylvania Public Unity Commission to increase the natural gas rate as of Oct.1.2003.The overall increase in revenues is approximately 23.9 percent, but it may vary from this percentage by different usage and applicable rate schedule. The more you use, the higher increasing rate you get.We will inform you about the changes in your bills. And the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission will schedule hearing to determine the proper rate level to be changed. If you have any problem, feel free to come to our offices and examine the material related to the proposed increase.You can also file a formal complaint to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, 17120. Once submitted, you can participate in the hearing at which you may present testimony and question witnesses to us.We will recalculate the finally determined rate every four months to reflect actual gas cost. And if current rate differs from the recalculated rate by more than 2 percentage, no matter increasing or decreasing, weâ€™ll recalculate and  change the rate.Dominion Peoples
