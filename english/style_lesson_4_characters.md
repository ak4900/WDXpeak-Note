### 技巧

+ Readers want actions in verbs, but they want characters as subjects even more
+ It is important to express actions in verbs, but the first principle of a clear style is this: Make the subjects of most of your verbs the main characters in your story.
+ How to diagnose a sentence:(ex4.1)
+ Underline the first seven or eight words.
+ Find the main characters.
+ Skim the passage for actions involving those characters, particularly actions buried in nominalizations. Ask Who is doing what?
+ The first step in diagnosing a dense style is to look at subjects. If you do not see main characters there expressed in a few short, concrete words, you have to look for them.
+ When you are revising your writing:
+ Make those characters the subjects of verbs naming those actions. Then string together those character-action pairs into complete sentences.
+ When you are reading:
+ Focusing on the characters, try to retell the story in the sentences, on action at a time. If that fails, list character-action pairs and rewrite the sentences yourself.
+ Most readers want the subjects of verbs to name flesh-and-blood characters. But often, you must write about abstractions. When you do, turn them into virtual characters by making them the subjects of verbs that tell a story. If readers are familiar with your abstractions, no problem. But when they are not, avoid using lots of other abstract nominalizations around them. When you revise and abstract passage, you may have a problem if the hidden characters are "people in general”. Try a general term for whoever is doing the action, such as researchers, social critics and so on. If not, try we. But the fact is, unlike many other languages, English has no good solution for naming a generic “doer”.
+ To choose between active and passive, you have to answer three questions:(ex4.2)
+ Must your readers know who is responsible for the action?
+ Would the active or passive verb help your readers move more smoothly from one sentence to the next?
+ Would the active or passive give readers a more consistent and appropriate point of view?
+ Use the passive in these contexts:
+ You don’t know who did an action, readers don’t care, or you don’t want them to know.
+ You want to shift a long and complex bundle of information to the end of a sentence, especially when doing so also lets you begin with a chunk of information that is shorter, more familiar, and therefore easier to understand.
+ You want to focus your readers’ attention on one or another character.
+ Some writers and editors avoid the first person by using the passive everywhere, but deleting an I or we doesn’t make a researcher’s thinking more objective. We know that behind those impersonal sentences are still flesh-and-blood people doing, thinking, and writing. In fact, the first-person I and we are common in scholarly prose when used with verbs that name actions unique to the writer. (ex4.3, 4.4, 4.5)
+ Noun+Noun+Noun:(ex4.6)
+ Strings of nouns feel lumpy, so avoid them, especially ones you invent. Revise compound nouns of your own invention, revise, especially when they include nominalizations. Just reverse the order of words and find prepositions to connect them.
+ When you read or write a style that seems complex, you must determine whether it needs to be so complex to express complex ideas precisely.
+ If you detect a needlessly complex style when you read, look for characters and actions so that you can unravel for yourself the complexity the writer needlessly inflicted on you.
+ When you write, use the same tools to detect when you are guilty of gratuitous complexity and, if you are, revise. When you do, you follow the Writer’s Golden Rule: Write to others as you would have others write to you.(ex4.7 4.8)

### Summing Up:

+ Readers judge prose to be clear when subjects of sentences name characters and verbs name actions.
+ If you tell a story in which you make abstract nominalizations its main characters and subjects, use as few other nominalizations as you can.
+ Use a passive if the agent of an action is self-evident.
+ Use a passive if it lets you replace a long subject with a short one.
+ Use a passive if it gives your readers a coherent sequence of subjects.
+ Use an active verb if it is a metadiscourse verb.
+ When possible, rewrite long compound noun phrases.
