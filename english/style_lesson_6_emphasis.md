+ When readers build up momentum in the first nine or ten words of a sentence, they more easily get through complicated material that follows.
+ Your readers want you to organize your sentences to help them manage two kinds of difficulty:
    + long and complex phrases and clauses
    + new information, particularly unfamiliar technical terms.
+ In general, your sentences should begin with elements that are relatively short: a short introductory phrase or clause, followed by a short, concrete subject, followed by a verb expressing a specific action. After the verb, the sentence can go on for several lines, if it is well constructed. The general principle is to carry the reader not from complexity to simplicity, but from simplicity to complexity.
+ We'll call this most emphatic part of a sentence its `stress`. How you manage the emphasis in that stress position helps establish the voice readers hear in your prose, because if you end a sentence on words that carry little meaning, your sentence will seem to end weakly.
