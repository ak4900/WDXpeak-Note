## 句子

+ When readers build up momentum in the first nine or ten words of a sentence, they more easily get through complicated material that follows.
+ Your readers want you to organize your sentences to help them manage two kinds of difficulty:
    + long and complex phrases and clauses
    + new information, particularly unfamiliar technical terms.
+ In general, your sentences should begin with elements that are relatively short: a short introductory phrase or clause, followed by a short, concrete subject, followed by a verb expressing a specific action. After the verb, the sentence can go on for several lines, if it is well constructed. The general principle is to carry the reader not from complexity to simplicity, but from simplicity to complexity.
+ We'll call this most emphatic part of a sentence its `stress`. How you manage the emphasis in that stress position helps establish the voice readers hear in your prose, because if you end a sentence on words that carry little meaning, your sentence will seem to end weakly.
+ You can easily check whether you have stressed the right words by reading your sentences aloud: As you speak the last few words, raise your voice and tap the table with your fingers. If you've stressed the wrong words, your voice and table thumping will feel wrong.
+ There is one more function performed by the stress of certain sentences, one that helps readers think a whole passage is coherent.
+ For a paragraph more than five or six sentences long, underline the sentence that you think best introduces or frames the rest of the paragraph. If you can't do that quickly, your paragraph probably has a problem.

## 技巧

**Put key words in the stress position of the first sentence of a passage in order to emphasize the key ideas that organized the rest of it**

### Diagnosis and Revision: Stress

1. Trim the end.
2. Shift peripheral ideas to the left.
3. Shift new information to the right.

### Six Syntactic Devices to Emphasize the Right Words

1. `There` shift. Some editors discourage all there is / there are constructions, but using them lets you shift a subject to the right to emphasize it.
2. `Passives (for the last time)` A passive verb lets you flip a subject and object.
3. `What` shift. This is another device that shifts a part of the sentence to the right, thereby emphasizing it more
4. `It` shift. When you have a subject consisting of a long NOUN CLAUSE, you can move it to the end of the sentence and start with an `it`.
5. `Not only X, but (also) Y (as well)`.
6. `Pronoun substitution and ellipsis`.

## 总结

1. Use the end of a sentence to introduce long, complex, or otherwise difficult-to-process material, particularly unfamiliar technical terms and new information.
2. Use the stress position at the very end to emphasize words that you want your readers to hear emphasized in their minds' ear.
3. Use the stress of a sentence that introduces a passage to announce the key themes that the rest of the passage will develop.

Readers have consistent preferences that you should try to meet:

1. They want sentences to get to the subject of a main clause quickly, so avoid opening more than a few sentences with long, complex phrases and subordinate clauses.
2. They want sentences that get past the subject of a main clause to a verb quickly, so do this:
    + Keep subjects short and, if you can, concrete -- ideally flesh-and-blood characters.
    + Open sentences with familiar information.
3. They want verbs that name specific actions, so do not bury actions in abstract nouns.
4. They deal with complexity more easily at the end of a sentence, so put there information that they will find least familiar, most complex, or most difficult to understand.
5. They are confused when each sentence in a series opens with a different subject, so through a passage, focus on a few topics that define what that passage is 'about'.
6. They more easily understand the ideas in a passage when they can connect them to a few key concepts, so thread through a passage the themes that signal its most important ideas.

In brief, write sentences that get to a short, concrete, familiar subject quickly, join that subject to a verb that names a specific action, and keep your subjects consistent. Readers want to see those patterns not just in the main clause of a sentence, but in every subordinate clause as well.
