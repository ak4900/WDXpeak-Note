## Background

New York City residents get one third of of daily caloric from foods purchased in restaurants. As we live under the suppliment of the restaurant products, assuring safe and healthy dining options is a public health priority. We are facing a dangerous health risk brought by trans fat in restaurant foods, but the risk is entirely preventable if the New York City restaurant patrons find a practical way to avoid trans fat.

According to the issue mentioned above, the Board of Health has ameended Article 81 of the New York City Health Code to restrict the service of products containing artificial trans fats at all FSEs.

By restricting FSEs from serving food that contains artificial trans fat, except for food served in the manufacturer's original sealed package, we can reduce New Yorkers' exposure to an avoidable hazard in the food environment that is associated with increased heart disease risk.

## Basis for restricting service of products containing artificial trans fat

In 2004, 23,000 New York City residents died from heart disease and nerly one-third of these individuals died before the age of 75. Such a huge number of patients makes heart disease the leading cause of death in NYC. The risk of coronary is associated with increased trans fat intake. If trans fat is replaced with currently available heart healthy alternatvies, 6% reduction in coronary heart disease can be achived. Other scientific estimate that up to 23% of coronary heart disease events can be avoided by replacing trans fat with healthy alternatives. Because an estimated one third of dietary tans fat comes form foods from restaurants, the continued presence of PHVO in restaurant foods represents an important contribution to cardiovascular risk for NYC diners.

Dietary trans fat increases the risk of heart disease by elevationg LDL("bad") cholesterol, and lowering HDL("good") chelesterol. What makes trans fat worse is its negative effect on "good cholesterol". Trans fatty acid intake is also concluded by IOM that the linearly realted to the total LDL concentration will inctreas the risk of coronary heart disease. As it is, the trans fat's intake is not recommended. An amount of "as low as possible" and below 1% of energy intake of trans fat is also recommended by the 2005 DGA and AHA guidelines respectively. Another document in January of 2006 from FDA's mandatory listing of trans fat content on nutrition facts labels of packaged food came into effect.

Approxiamtely 80% of dietary trans fat is found in industrially-produced PHVO, which is used for frying and baking and is present in many processed foods. Approximately 20% is natrually occurring and is found in small smounts in dairy and meat products from ruminant animals.

The artificial trans fat found in PHVO is produced when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil in a process called hydrogenation. Common FSE sources of artificial trans fat include: foods fried in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils; margarine and vegetable shortening; prepared foods such as pre-fried French fries, fried chicken, taco shells and donuts; baked goods such as hamburger buns, pizza dough, crackers, cookies and pies; and pre-mixed ingredients such as pancake and hot chocolate mix.

The major source of dietary trans fat, found in PHVO, can be replaced with currently availabel heart healthy alternatives. Artificial trans fat has been successfully removed in Denmark by limiting industrially produced trans fat content in food to 2% of total calories from fat. Canada and US. also limit trans fat since 2006. Many manufacturers have reformulated a number of their existing products that are now widely availbale as "zero grams" trans fat (defined by the FDA as <0.5 grams per serving) on supermarket shelves. Many experience demonstrates that artificial trans fat can be replaced without consumers noticing an effect. Acceptable healthier alternative to PHVOs include traditional mono and poly unsaturated vagetable oils(e.g, canola, corn, olive, etc.) that have not been hydrogenated, as well as newly developed oils such as those made from specially cultivated varieties of soybeans, safflowers, and sunflowers. Further, many of the newer trans fat-free oils have long 'fry lives' and other favored characteristics of PHVOs. Educational and enforcement efforts will seek to promote a shift to healthier fats, which will also expand production of products that will increase the market supply of alternatives to hydrogenated oils.
