# Lily's Book 21-end

## Chapter 21  Tommy

Throughout our conversation, Haoli sought my confirmation on the satisfactions of being a mother and the tender feelings of a mother for a child. She knew only mothers could understand a mother’s love for her child. Haoli was right. I understood her feelings for Adam because of my son Tommy. But I did not tell her that besides overwhelming feelings of tenderness and love, the thought of Tommy also brought heartache and pain. 

*****

In the spring of 1994, I fainted for the first time in my life while walking around the shops in Nanjing Jingling Hotel. I was rushed to the hotel doctor and when I came to, he told me I was pregnant. Tom was overjoyed and I felt confused. We had been married for over a year and started discussing having a baby. I was not entirely against it. Although I knew I needed to do “something” professionally, the insecurity of being a new immigrant stopped me from applying to a school or looking for a job. In my paralyzed state, raising a child seemed a great excuse to justify “doing nothing.” But the reality of pregnancy still shocked my system. At twenty-four I wanted to go back to school and figure out my life first. I was not “ready” for a baby. Instead of excitement about becoming a mother, I agonized. 

Seven weeks before my due date, my water leaked and I was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. Fearing infection, the doctor decided to induce labor immediately but warned me about having a baby so many weeks pre-mature: He might be born with undeveloped lungs, or worse. The prospect of losing the baby brought horror to my heart. For the first time in my pregnancy I realized what the little life inside meant to me. It was as important as my own life, more important than my own life. I would do anything to bring him safely into the world, to care for him and make sure he was okay. Though I did not have a God, I promised, and I prayed. 

Everything changed for me the day Tommy was born. After the nurse left the room, I stared at the little living breathing human being for hours in a plastic incubator. I was in utter disbelief I had given birth to him. Born six weeks premature, Tommy had small tufts of black hair standing on top of his head but no eyelashes. His fingernails and toenails were not grown. His tear ducts were undeveloped so he cried no tears. He weighed only 5 lb. 6 oz., less than a small turkey, and his whole body fit on my forearm. 
The feeling was a mix of awe, a heartbreaking tenderness, and an overwhelming sense of responsibility. I knew the life of this little creature lied entirely in my hands and to care for him was what I was here to do. Nothing else was more important. 

When we brought Tommy home from the hospital, even on an eighty degree September day, I wrapped him up mummy style in a blanket to keep him warm. The doctor was concerned that being premature, he could not keep up his body temperature and I was worried to death he would be chilled. The doctor also worried the surfactant in Tommy’s lungs may not have fully developed. Whenever he slept for extended periods of time, I would rush to his crib and poke at him to make sure he was still breathing. 

When I was breast-feeding Tommy, I used to smell his breath. I understood for the first time why it was called “baby breath”. It was the sweetest smell on earth. I loved the smell of his skin and everything that came in contact with it, his clothes, stuffed animals, and the soft green cotton blanket he slept with --before folding it and putting it away each morning, I would inhale deeply into it. Tommy loved my scent too. Because I breast fed, I let Tommy sleep in my bed. That was what Chinese mothers would do. I slept with mother until I went to elementary school. After a while he refused to sleep in his crib. When he got a little older and had to sleep separately, he would come to my bed and smell my pillow. Sometimes he picked up my arm and smelled it. Then I would ask him to open his mouth so I could smell his breath. 

Tommy was my little tail and we were inseparable. If I lingered in the bathroom a bit too long, he would sit outside the door waiting for me to come out. If I stayed up reading in my study after putting him to sleep, he would wake up to find me and fall sleep on the floor next to me. When he saw Tom and me sitting together on the couch, he would squeeze in between and push Tom away. He declared: “She is my mama.”

Motherhood brought a tenderness to my heart deeper than anything I ever felt before. But being a suburban housewife gnawed me with insecurity and guilt. I was only twenty five and I wanted to do something with my life besides being a mother and a wife. I loved Tom and Tommy and our beautiful house. But in the middle of doing laundry or washing dishes, I thought to myself: Is this all? I did not attend one of the best universities in China to spend my days picking up Tom’s dirty underwear and socks. I lay awake in the middle of the night with Tom and Tommy fast sleep and felt a nagging worry and emptiness. 

*****

After the initial fascination with American life, I found life as a suburban housewife with a small child isolating. In China I lived in cities full of people and action. In Pittsburgh suburbs neighbors lived far apart and interacted sparsely. I saw more cars than people. Even after I got to know my neighbors and was invited to various gatherings, I had a hard time fitting in. My neighbors were proud of their homes and lawns and spent much time keeping them perfect. The housewives seemed content cooking and cleaning, attending church, organizing school bake-sales and little league baseball games. With great enthusiasm, they planned summer picnics, holiday parties, and kids’ graduations. Every summer, they went to the same destinations for their annual family vacation, talked about it for months before and after, and felt short-changed if the weather failed them on a good tan. They talked endlessly about their husbands and children, other women’s marital problems and their own. They watched the same TV series and read the same romances, mysteries, and women’s magazines -- from which they derived their ideas about love and romance, kids and family, how to keep their house and gardens, and what to buy, wear and eat. 

I joined them for morning walks and afternoon tea, Tupperware and Avon parties, and even a photo club where members bought special albums, pens, and glues to build a “fade proof” album. Hard as I tried, I found these activities mind numbing. I was in my mid-twenties and most of those women were in their mid-thirties to early forties. The neighborhood women seemed to wear “I don’t have to work” as a badge of honor for having married well. I found being a housewife lame. As a Chinese girl growing up under Mao’s vision, I had expected to be a modern woman making productive contributions outside the home. The role of suburban housewife left me with feelings of guilt and shame. In China, I had imagined America the land of the “modern woman”. It turned out my suburban neighbors were more “traditional” than me. The life of a middle class suburban wife was not what I signed up for. I had to escape it and I knew no other way of escaping than leaving my marriage. My divorce devastated Tom and broke his heart. But it broke my heart to be leaving Tommy behind.
Tommy was only four and hardly understood what was happening. But he knew mama and daddy were no longer going to be together. He said nothing but drew picture after picture and handed them to me. In one picture he drew mama and daddy together with Tommy in the middle all holding hands. He enclosed all of us in a big heart. In another he drew mommy, daddy, and Tommy together in a house. Those pictures brought tears to my eyes. I knew I was letting Tommy down by breaking up the family he so loved. 

To make matters worse, Tom, in his desperate attempt to save his marriage, used Tommy as a weapon. He told Tommy his mommy was leaving because she no longer wanted him. With Tommy and me in the car he accelerated to dangerous speeds, leaving me yelling in the front and Tommy screaming in the backseat. And on New Year’s Eve 2000, with Tommy and me in the house, he threatened suicide with a gun. I called his family. His father and brother could not restrain him and had to call the police.

To end this madness, I knew I had to leave immediately. When I moved out of our beautiful suburban house for a Spartan two-bedroom apartment, Tommy “helped” carry small items. He said: “I want to help mama move because I want to live with mama.” But the little boy did not get his wish. Tom did everything he could to stop me from leaving and my sole instinct was to escape. I wanted no alimony, none of our worldly possessions, or custody of Tommy. All I wanted was my freedom. I didn’t feel I had a choice. Realistically, I could not be a single mother, work full time, attend school part time, and still have a life, especially without family support.  

*****

After the divorce I saw Tommy every other weekend and one evening a week. On our weekends together, I did what I thought would make Tommy happy but was frequently too tired or preoccupied with work, school, or relationships to be fully attentive. Often he wanted me to watch a movie with him while all I wanted to do was take a nap. Or he was fussy and needed my attention, and all I could do was lose my patience and yell at him -- I had been too overwhelmed with my own life to be supportive. I knew I needed to be a better mother but I could barely manage my own life. Evening visits were even harder. They were painfully short. By the time I picked Tommy up after work and fed him, it was time to take him back. Tom traveled a lot. Often I had to drop him off at his grand pap’s house. As the little boy disappeared into Pap’s basement door carrying a yellow Pockeman backpack that seemed too big and heavy for him, I would watch helplessly, torn up inside, and weep the whole drive back. I was his mother, I was supposed to tuck him in, read him a bedtime story, kiss him good night, and cover him up when he kicked off his blanket at night. But I couldn’t do any of that. I had given up my rights. Sometimes I heard stories about Tommy being bullied at school. One boy named Chris routinely picked on Tommy, stole his books, pushed him to the ground and called him a “China boy.” These moments cut at me and left me with unrelenting guilt, especially when I was not there to comfort him when he was picked on for being my son. 

Tom used to say to me: “I do not care that you broke my heart, but you are breaking the heart of this little boy who loves you so much.” And I would get angry at Tom for laying guilt trips on me. But lying awake at night Tom’s words would throb like an open wound. I knew he was right. 

Most of my friends and dates were never married and had no children. As the girl who went to parties and on dates, I was fun and carefree; but when I went home, I was a divorced woman with a son. I couldn’t reconcile the two sides of my life so I kept them separate. I never let any of my dates meet Tommy. But the divided life I lived caused a constant tension in me. The time I had Tommy, I declined dates; and when I went out, I felt guilty for neglecting Tommy. 

*****

Mother and my sisters were all against my divorce. They were even more dismayed at my relinquishing custody of Tommy. “You are the child’s mother, you are obligated to care for him,” my sister Lijie wrote me in letters on behalf of the family. Some friends and colleagues turned their back on me and deemed me a bad mother. I couldn’t escape from the prevailing cultural judgment that child-rearing was a mother’s responsibility. A woman who shied away from this responsibility was deemed not only a bad mother but a flawed human being. I was fully aware of this judgment and lived with the weight of it daily, even with the boyfriends. 

If I divulged I had given up Tommy’s custody to Tom, even my single boyfriends and dates would question my decision: “She must be a heartless and uncaring person to give up her own child,” I would read into their mind silently. It got to the point that whenever a date or lover asked me about Tommy, the thought raced through my head: This man loves me because I am attractive and fun; but if he knew how I had broken Tom’s heart and left Tommy, would he still love me?”

All this made me extremely self-conscious and defensive about anything having to do with Tommy. Though none of the men I dated ever met Tommy, I would interpret any offhand comment they might make about my responsibilities to Tommy as a veiled dig against me, and I attacked back ferociously. Tommy was the tender spot of my heart I protected against any intrusive force. Only years later would I understand that my defensiveness and rage were triggered by my own unresolved guilt. 

My mind churned whether I had made the right decision giving up Tommy’s custody. Was I a selfish person who only cared about my own freedom, or was I a realistic new immigrant trying to make it on my own? I loved Tommy with all my heart from the moment he was born, before he was born; but I had come to a point where I knew my motherly love would mean little if I couldn’t save myself. When I argued it back and forth in my head, my decision seemed to make sense to me. But the guilt never lifted. 

## Chapter 22           Liver, Dignity or Sex 

Zhang Sui had to attend to some business in Xian and Lihui was accompanying him because of his heart condition. She invited me to take time off from my research and go with them to visit the famous Qin Tombs, Terra Cotta soldiers, and Hua Mountain. I accepted Lihui’s invitation but not because I cared to tour Xian. I knew Zhang Sui ran in the circle of officials and entrepreneurs who kept ernai. I hoped to get to know them andtheir lives..The purpose of the trip was to get business in Xian for an entrepreneur named Qing Li. Zhang Sui had large guanxi networks in Xian and Qing Li wanted to tap into them. Qing fascinated me with his rise from rural origins with no money and family connections to owning a billion Yuan telecom business. In his book Anxious Wealth, anthropologist John Osburg observed that Chinese entrepreneurs lived in constant anxiety despite their business success. I wanted to hear Qing’s story from the source. 

 “To succeed, Qing Li paved the road with money and bought all the guanxi he needed,” Lihui told me. “When ‘dongcong xiacao’ (a precious Chinese herb) was more expensive than gold, he gifted the officials boxes and boxes of them.” 
“But how could he bribe with no money?” 

“Probably using savings or borrowed money from friends and relatives: ‘To catch the wolf, one must be willing to sacrifice her child as the lure,’’ Lihui said, sympathizing with Qing Li’s sacrifice and admiring his resolve. 
The plan was to meet Qing Li in Nanjing and fly to Xian with him. Lihui would not let me pay for any of my travel expenses. Qing Li’s office would arrange everything. 

It was VIP treatment all the way. Qing Li sent two luxury sedans to pick us up from the train station and the driver treated us to an elaborate lunch at a fancy restaurant before depositing us at a posh five star hotel. At lunch I talked to our driver, a young man named Wang Lin who worked for Qing Li. Wang grew up in a small rural town in Henan province and came to Nanjing for college. He found a job in Nanjing after graduation but could not get a Nanjing Hukou because neither he nor his wife was from Nanjing. This left them ineligible for benefits such as public education for their child, low interest mortgage loans, medical insurance, unemployment compensation and retirement. To address the problem, they bought an apartment. For with the purchase of an apartment at a minimum of 60 SM, a non-Nanjing resident could get a Nanjing Hukou for himself, his wife, and an unmarried child. For every additional 20 SM, he could sponsor another Nanjing Hukou for his immediate family. Wang Lin bought a 100 SM apartment for 1,600,000 Yuan even though they really could not afford it. His monthly salary was only 4000 Yuan. Wang’s brother also worked in Nanjing and Wang Lin hoped to sponsor him with his apartment purchase. They pooled all their savings and borrowed money from friends and family for the down payment and saved every Yuan they made to pay the mortgage. They were China’s “house slaves.” 

“It is not easy,” Lihui said to me after Wang dropped us off. “So young--but works his butt off to pay for the apartment. I noticed he wore the same shirt he wore last time I saw him. I do not think he has much money left after paying for the mortgage every month.” 

Lihui was observant. Wang Lin was no doubt strapped for cash with hefty mortgage payments. But Lihui’s thinking also reflected how Chinese people judged others by what they wore, drove, carried, drank and smoke. Mianzi was an integral part of guanxi and guanxi was...well everything. 

******
On the way to the hotel, we visited Qing Li in his office. Yang Xu, the twenty-something sales manager greeted us earnestly and ushered us to Qing Li’s office. Though I had never met him, I could pick out Qing Li as soon as I walked into his smoke-filled office. Smoking cigarettes and drinking tea with three other men, Qing Li dominated the space with his poise. He was in his early forties, of average height and build, and bald. He was not good looking by any measure, but his eyes sparked warmth and intelligence. In front of his honored guest, Zhang Sui, Qing Li carried himself with a measured modesty. But his posed humbleness could not conceal a quiet confidence. 

Although it was our first meeting, Qing Li expressed his “admiration” for me. Lihui had told him that I had traveled to over 50 countries, many of them remote. I told him it was not hard to do. All it took was some money, time, and lots of curiosity. 

“That is the problem,” Qing Li said with regret, “I have no time. Maybe someday when I am not so busy.” 

Qing Li sent Yang Xu to fetch his wife. Qing Li’s wife ran the company’s finance department. She was an attractive twenty something in short hair and modest attire. After being introduced to everyone in the room, she returned to work. I assumed even though she worked for the company, as Qing Li’s wife, she was not supposed to partake in her husband’s’ business mingling. Chinese men seldom included their wives in business entertainment for two reasons. First, women are supposed to “be in charge of the inner” at home while men are out to make money; second, in business socializing, women are often taken as “entertainment” and “lubricant” and these functions are unbecoming a wife’s “respectability.” Most men take their mistresses instead to spice up the gaiety of such gatherings. 

After Qing’s wife left the room, Lihui complimented Qing Li on her attractiveness, flawless skin and nice aura. Qing Li thanked Lihui and reinforced the praise: “She is a nice woman, diligent, responsible and supportive. She knew nothing about finance but is learning fast. I am proud of her.” I thought to myself: What a nice guy, successful but modest, intelligent but unimposing, and, loves his wife. 

Lihui later confided in me that Qing Li ‘s wife was from the rural area and met Qing Li when she worked as a hostess at a restaurant. But Qing Li carefully concealed her background to befit his status as a successful businessman. As far as the world knew, she was an urban professional. 

*****

I surprised Lihui when I agreed to attend the evening’s banquet. She knew I hated wasteful banquets with the liquor flowing in cigarette- smoke filled rooms. I had an ulterior motive. I wanted to meet Zhang Sui’s business associates and observe how guanxi was built and business conducted around a banquet table. 

The banquet took place in an ostentatious private suite with gold curtains, gaudy carpet and ornate red wood furnishing in a “wild game” restaurant. To add a touch a class, Chinese calligraphies of Mao’s Poem “The snow in Qing garden” adornedthe walls. It was said Mao loved wild game. People favored elaborate banquets in extravagant private suites because it allowed the host to honor his guest while flaunting his wealth. However, President Xi Jinpin’s recent anti-corruption campaign forbad officials from attending lavish banquets and drinking expensive liquor. Business in many high-end restaurants had plummeted and the stock of Maotai had dropped. But people were skeptical. They were waiting to see whether the campaign meant business or was mere smoke and mirrors as the preceding ones. The Chinese government at times cracked down on corruption where it was most visible in order to appease public rage. The banning of banquets was an easy target for fighting corruption in the eyes of the public. But who knew what was going on behind closed doors?  
The seating arrangements at a Chinese banquet table follow strict rules. Upper seats, lower seats and right and left seats all carry significant meaning. One can flatter or offend with it. 

The upper seats are seats in the middle that are facing the door or against the wall. They are reserved for senior and honored guests. Lower seats are the seats opposite to upper seats at the end of the table for the junior and less important guests. Besides upper and lower, left is more respectable than right. Typically an elder male with high official rank sits in the honored seats while younger, lower ranked people, and females sit in less honored seats. At a business banquet in Chengdu years ago, my American colleague was seated in an upper seat next to the host because he was male, older and American while I was seated in a lower seat next to secretaries because I was female, younger, and Chinese. Worse, they also expected me to interpret for him! No one knew the anointed male guest of honor worked for me. I was initially annoyed by such presumptuousness. But after reminding myself of the culture I was in, I dismissed the whole scene as farce and blew off my assignment as translator. A high school classmate who was an educated professional told me she hated provincial Guangdong province because at banquets, she was asked to sit as a separate table with the women and children away from her husband. Once placed in a seat, each individual was allocated the attention, respect and opportunity to speak appropriate to their seating. To the cynical eye, the Chinese banquet was a miniature of Chinese society: Ostentatious, impressionable, hierarchical, oppressive and immobile. 

*****

For this banquet, the honored seats were given to two senior cadres from China mobile and Zhang Sui. Lihui and I sat on the left and Qing Li and other men on the right. Yang Xu and Zhang’s business manager Meng Kai sat at the end of the table. 

The first half hour of the banquet was complete chaos. After a standup group toast, the people of lower ranks walked over to toast the senior ones at their seats and repeated the drill with each person down the table. Some of the senior people did the same thing, walking around the table to toast everyone as a gesture of humility. As one round of toasting wound down, another round revved up, over and over. The whole room was like a modified game of musical chairs with people standing up, walking around, sitting down and springing up once again to find a new person to toast. With each round of toasting, people got drunker, louder, and merrier. The only people who stayed fixed in the seats the whole time were Zhang Sui, Lihui and me. Zhang Sui sat immobile to show his importance and “big brother” status. And I was pardoned for being the “honored guest” as Zhang Sui’s sister-in-law and an “American.” Otherwise I would have been considered arrogant not to toast back. As much as people bond and flatter in banquets, they can also alienate and offend, intentionally and unintentionally. People derive great meaning from whether a person initiates a toast, returns a toast, drinks more or less, and sits or stands while toasting or being toasted. How much a senior person speaks to a junior and how he speaks to the junior also carried significance. Punishment can be publicly meted out when a senior withholds words, as Zhang Sui did to Meng Kai to show his displeasure with Meng’s recent performance in the business, and everyone knew it. 

Zhang started to get drunk, talking loudly, and dominated the conversation, while others listened and spoke when spoken to. I was the only one who asked questions. But it was hard to carry a conversation at a banquet. Loud chatter drowned out people’s polite and insubstantial answers. The host placed orders for the whole table, keeping in mind the preferences of the important guests. Since I was one of the honored guests and Lihui told him I was a vegetarian, Qing Li ordered almost all vegetarian dishes. Underlings like Meng Kai and Yang Xu had no chance to speak, no say in what they ate, and served as runners to make sure everything runs smoothly at the banquet. 

As Qing Li’s cohost, Yang Xu was supposed to fill Zhang’s glass with liquor as soon as it emptied. But seeing how drunk Zhang Sui was getting, the cadres from China mobile and Lihui advised him to drink less. Zhang’s doctor had forbidden him from drinking because he had heart problems from years of heavy drinking and smoking. But he refused to listen. Caught between Zhang Sui’s command to fill the glass and Lihui’s order to stop, Yang Xu was at a loss what to do.

Yang Xu’s disobedience annoyed Zhang Sui. He pointed his finger at Yang Xu and shouted: “You little man, do you still want to make a living? If you do not pour, I will kick you in the balls so hard to ensure you will never be able to make babies.” 

The room hushed at this sudden nastiness. The carousing and flattering came to an abrupt halt.The room was awash in stunned facesfixated on their plates. Yang Xu had married within the year and had no child. In China, wishing somebody never to have a child was probably the greatest insult one could dish out. It usually instigatedfistfights. But because of the power imbalance, Yang Xu said nothing. He tried his hardest to plaster a smile on his pale young face. 

Lihui was visibly embarrassed. She scolded Zhang Sui for saying such mean things and I joined in. In their relationship, Lihui was Zhang’s source of classiness, conscience and mianzi. Lihui told me all Zhang’s “little brothers” revered her because she was the only soul brave enough tostand up for them against Zhang’s outburstsLihui could be brave because she had earned thatright.Unlike other men, Zhang took Lihui to banquets with him because Lihui was stunningly beautiful and classy and madeZhang Sui a man other men envied.. But in the early years of their relationship, he had only wanted her tobe seen and not heard.. At one banquet when Lihui openly challenged him, heyelled:: “Woman, shut up, go home.” Lihui was humiliated. She left in the middle of the banquetand broke up with him. Zhang Sui learned his lesson. After that, he was more respectful and learned to allow Lihui to speak.

Knowing he had done something wrong, Zhang Sui mumbled an inaudible defense, lit a cigarette and went on with his drinking. When the newcomer Li Xin walked in with unsteady steps, the table started a new round of toasting. The obsequious smile returned to Yang Xu’s face. A new wave of loud chatter blew away the silencethat had descended over the room. 

Li Xin was a mid-level manager at Nanjing China Mobile. He was a Xuzhou No. 1 alumni and I had met him at previous banquets. He had just come from another banquet and was already drunk. But drunk or not, he was obliged to toast everyone at the table to show his collegiality. His came to honor Zhang Sui because he needed Zhang’s help with a past due promotion that he would never get without Zhang’s help. 

When he stumbled over to toast me, I told him since I was drinking water, he could drink water too, or drink half a glass. But he insisted on toasting me bottoms up, to show his respect. As I watched him going around the table in unsteady steps and bleary eyes, spilling liquor on his shirt and making bitter faces as if drinking poison, I felt sorry for him. 

A few at the table felt sorry for him too. They themselves must have been in similar situations. Some of them told Li Xin to pace himself. But to prove his sincerity and manliness, and to get his promotion, Li Xin drank on bravely. The merry making of the banquet took on the mood of martyring. 

*****
Besides endless toasting, addressing one another in familial terms - brother, uncle, Lihui aunt or me sister, and flattering, there was no real conversation. The interactions were so shallow and contrived it was comical, at least to a sober spectator like me. But the language was peppered with terms of endearment, of family, feelings, admiration, sworn devotion and positive reinforcement. Qing Li put up his thumbs to express his awe for Zhang Sui and admiration for Lihui; beating on his chest Li Xing blurted out his adulation for what a wonderful woman Lihui had been for Zhang Sui. Zhang listened on with a complacent smile getting drunk on both alcohol and blarney. 
When we first sat down, I asked Lihui why Wang Lin, the young man who picked us up from the train station, was not present. Lihui told me he had yet to move up the ranks to be invited. It was an honor to be included because it meant one was admitted into an important guanxi network. But to me, the admission was hardly worth the climb as it only won them the “privilege” to be treated like servants, taking orders and abuse from tyrants like Zhang Sui. Even the more senior players like Qing Li and Li Xin had to sit through the mind-numbing interactions and drink themselves silly to show respect and fit in. Lihui told me this was another reason why she sent Cancan to Canada. If Cancan stayed in China and wanted to get ahead, he had to do what Yang Xu and Li Xin did: Kiss his way up and drink himself to death. 

Lihui and I were the only women at the banquet. No one brought his wife. The heavy drinking and carousing made it hard for a woman to fit in. The banquet was an exhibition of masculinity and male bonding. Lihui told me if she and I were not present, some of them might have brought their mistresses; and the evening would have ended up in a KTV with hired hostesses offering sexual services.

*****
All the toasting, calling each other brothers and flattering were attempts to “build bonds and deepen feelings.” Although not a word of business was uttered, everyone at the table was thinking business.  

While Zhang Sui sat at the summit of the pyramid and relished all the adoration and flattery, he needed these men as they needed him. Qing Li needed Zhang Sui to get him clients and Zhang Sui needed Qing Li to buy him mianzi. He wined and dined the two senior cadres from China mobile and the roomful of people with Qing Li’s money. Li Xin counted on Zhang Sui’s guanxi to get his promotion and Zhang Sui planned to benefit his own business by placing Li Xing in a key position. Meng Kai, as Zhang’s business partner/manager based his entire career and livelihood on Zhang Sui’s guanxi, and Zhang Sui needed him to do all the grunt work while reaping the benefits. Yang Xu was proud to be included in the circle of his superiors and hoped to please Qing Li by pleasing his guests. Besides being wined and dined and treated like a King, as a “Big Brother,” Zhang Sui also needed to show he could take care of all his “little brothers.” Placing everyone in his debt would cement his king-of-the-jungle position. Beneath the frivolous carousing, was a well-choreographed play where hidden desires and motives were silently bartered. 

In their moments of delirious drunkenness with alcohol flowing through their veins, these men felt some genuine camaraderie and kinship. Chinese people seldom show physical affection. One rarely sees friends and family hug or kiss publicly. But in banquets, especially towards the end when everyone was falling over drunk, men leaned on men for support like wounded soldiers and hugged for consolation. In a world of mistrust, where everyone hides behind social masks of mianzi, this moment of hearty drinking must have given them much needed emotional solidarity. Perhaps that is why they drank night after night.

In China, bribery is never straightforward, but carried out with cunning and discreetness. An entrepreneur doesn’t hand an official a bag of money and expect to get help. The official would never trust him enough to accept the bribe without a proper introduction. He would not know which bag was “safe” and which could spell disaster if the deal soured. Only with the proper introduction and when the entrepreneur becomes a “brother” in the official’s guanxi network, his gifts would be accepted and transactions would be made. That is why Chinese people know “with power comes money, but money alone is not enough.” The path to power is guanxi and the Chinese guanxi network is extensive, tight knit, and dynamic. Banquets and drinking were the way for these men to penetrate one another’s guanxi network to survive and succeed.
Suddenly, it dawned on me why women in the chatroom called their patrons “uncle,” “gandie” (adopted father). It was no different from how men addressed each other in family terms: brother, uncle, gandie. China was a family centered culture. People who are considered family are treated with care while strangers are left to twist in the wind. People strived to build family bonds by addressing each other in familial terms because they wanted to be the insider. Men squeeze in this circle through hearty drinking and humbling themselves, like Yang Xu. But what do young women do? They obviously couldn’t fit in the heaving-drinking male-bonding banquet environment. Even if they were included in the banquets, they would never be treated as equals but as objects of vanity and desire. One feasible way for a woman to access the male power culture was through her body. That was why some young women, educated and ambitious, chose to become ernai to rich and powerful men. If Yang Xu, Meng Kai and Li Xin were selling their liver and dignity for opportunities and guanxi, why shouldn’t those women sell sex for the same reason when selling their liver was not an option? Especially when the price of selling one’s liver could mean life and death.

People were shocked when Kaifu Li, the former CEO of Google China, and one of the most prominent entrepreneurs in China, was diagnosed with lymph node cancer at fifty-one. It turned out he was not the only one. Many successful Chinese entrepreneurs in their forties and fifties had been diagnosed with cancer, or cardiac disease because of high stress, heavy drinking and smoking, and environmental pollutants. 

My high school classmate Songfeng who was a futures broker often complained in the chatroom how work stress was killing him. I asked him where the pressure came from. He told me they were trading in high volumes and high stakes, and one wrong prediction could cost his employer and clients millions. I told him to do the best he could and not worry about the rest. In the worst case he could always find another job. He said he felt a sense of responsibility to his employer. But later in the conversation, he divulged that the real source of the stress came from the lack of a social safety net in China and worries about rising inflation. After years of hard work, he had saved enough money to retire but he couldn’t. The Chinese stock market was unregulated and most investors lost money because the market prioritized bailing out bankrupted state enterprises over the interests of the shareholders. Songfeng had no choice but to put his savings in a bank that paid 4-6% interest against an inflation rate of 8%. He had enough money to live on but a severe illness would wipe him out. He told me many middle aged professionals in China were in his straits. They worked hard to accumulate enough for a safety net in the event of severe illness. But working hard while bearing unrelenting stress was a recipe for severe illness. It was a vicious circle without escape.
Besides the price they paid sacrificing their liver, these men paid a psychological and emotional priceswallowing their dignity to pander and bribe. It turned Tiger Pan depressive. Feeling out of control in his business life, he sought total control in his personal life, over his wife, children and mistresses. It was the case of the oppressed turning into the oppressor to administer a perverse justice. It was not masculine to cajole, coax, and flatter at banquets for guanxi. It occurred to me that control of their women and mistresses was probably their only safe outlet to salve a bruised masculinity. 

## Chapter 23           Guanxi is Everything 

The next morning, Zhang Sui, Lihui, Qing Li, Yang Xu and I flew to Xian. In Xian airport, Zhang Sui’s contact got our boarding passes, checked our luggage and escorted us to a China Mobile VIP lounge. I surveyed the long lines in the airport and realized the importance of guanxi in China. It came in handy in large and small ways and brought mianzi to people who had it. When we left Xuzhou, Zhang skipped the public parking lot and nonchalantly parked in the Xuzhou Railroad Police Station parking lot because he was “brother” with the head of the police. When the police chief dropped us off at the curb, he ignored the “No stopping” rule, parked the car, and chatted with us unhurried. The policeman on duty, stern-faced, came over to ticket us until he saw his boss. He broke into a fawning smile, handed cigarettes out to his boss and Zhang, and greeted Lihui and me warmly. When I asked Lihui whether Zhang parked in the police parking lot to save money, she said, “No--He was showing off his mianzi as a Big Brother in Xuzhou. Wherever he went, he wanted his ‘brothers’ to treat him like a VIP.”

With the world’s largest population of one point three billion, Chinese people had to compete fiercely to do anything. One either finds a way to stand out or gets trampled in the crowd. Those with special power stand above the crowd, and frequently, even above the law. The most famous case was the story “My father is Li Gang.” In a notorious 2010 hit and run incident, the son of a police chief in Baodin City, Hebei Province, killed one pedestrian with his car and severely injured another. He did not stop but sped off to pick up his girlfriend. When the police finally caught up with him, he was unrepentant: “I dare you to sue me. My father is Li Gang.” He literally thought he could get away with murder by dropping his father’s name. He was sentenced to six years in prison. 

Such inequality causes people to do whatever it takes to get on the “right” side of it. If heavy drinking at banquets does the trick, so be it. I told Zhang Sui that he and his buddies were masochists, racing to cirrhosis. But after a couple of days I began to understand the cost-benefit thinking behind their destructive behavior. Every slug of liquor promised money, opportunities, and future perks.

*****
After two days of nonstop banqueting, I begged off to visit the Qin Terra Cotta soldiers. Two entrepreneurs Zhang Jian and Li Bin insisted on escorting Lihui and me. Both of them had seen the terra cotta soldiers before. They waited while a guide took me around. They paid for my tickets, the guide, my souvenirs, and lunch for Lihui and me. They carried my water bottles, umbrella, and shopping bags. These were not clerks or junior employees acting as our lackeys. They were partners in companies with 100+ employees. Neither were they there to impress Lihui and me with their gallantry. Chinese men typically do not carry bags or open doors for women. Even in courting, they see waiting on a woman as unmanly. In humbling themselves and serving as our flunkeys, Li Bin and Zhang Jian hoped to indebt Zhang Sui so he would feel obligated to help them with their businesses. 

While I understood why they were there, I couldn’t help but seeing their toadying a waste of their time. Instead of waiting around for me, they could be getting real work done in the office. But Libin told me they were doing the most important work for their business: Building guanxi. Without the right guanxi they would win no orders; and without orders, there would be no work to do in the office. 

Zhang Jian learned this the hard way and told us his story. 

He was born in Xiao County an hour outside Xuzhou, a place known for its black society activities. His two uncles had spent much of their lives in and out of jail and the most famous person from his hometown was the head of the local black society, Zhang Bing. Zhang Bing’s lawlessness provoked such instant terror in people that it was said that the local mothers used his name to quiet their children: “Stop crying, or Zhang Bing will come.” But with bribes, Zhang Bing bought a seat as the “People’s representative” in Xuzhou city government. He remained in that post until his involvement in a criminal case was exposed. 

To keep him out of that environment, Zhang Jian’s parents sent him to live with his aunt in Xian when he was a teenager. But after college, he found out at a job interview competing against hundreds of applicants that no matter where he went, there was no escape from the “brotherhood” environment. 
When it was his turn, the big boss closed the door and led with the question: “If you happened on a colleague fist-fighting a stranger, what would you do?” Without thinking, Zhang said: “Help him fight.” The boss said nothing but abruptly told Zhang the interview was over and he could leave. 
“I kicked myself for saying that. For sure I thought I had blown the interview,” Zhang said animatedly.

But a week later, he was astonished to learn he was one of the two people hired. His boss later told him he was hired for his willingness to help his colleague in a fight. “It was no different where I grew up. It was always ‘brotherhood.’ Only the ‘big brother’ in my company had an official title. Those who were his ‘brothers’ were taken care of and those who were not never got ahead.” 

Zhang became one of his boss’s trusted “brothers” and thrived in the company. He worked in the Shanghai office for three years before going out on his own. “I knew how the business ran and saw a great opportunity. And I knew companies in Xian needed this outplacement service but still did not have it.” 

That was three years ago. And it had been a tough three years. Even with a solid business model in an unsaturated market, Zhang could not get contracts because he lacked guanxi. Many companies needed his services but the party leaders decided whether to award Zhang’s company contracts or not. To sway their decision required lots of drinking at banquets and gifts. But even with that, there were always competitors with guanxi that he did not have. New to Xian’s business circle, he was an outsider. In Shanghai, if he could prove the value of his services at a reasonable cost, he could generally win the contract. But not in Xian. 

Zhang recounted how he and his team spent six months courting a client only to lose the order at the last minute to someone with more guanxi. The manager informed Zhang regretfully: “We really liked your services and wanted to use your company but the leader ordered us to use another company he had guanxi with.” 

“Six months! Six months of time, energy, all wasted because somebody knew somebody we didn’t,” Zhang exasperated, “But there was nothing we could do. Sometimes I regret starting my own business and moving from Shanghai to Xian. I had it made in Shanghai. Good paying job, steady income, good clients, my boss loved me…” 

Lihui and I told him his thinking was correct to tackle a virgin market and build something of his own He simply had not anticipated the different business climate between Shanghai and Xian. We urged him not to give up. 
“I can’t give up,” Zhang said resolutely. “I have employees who depend on me, and I need to support my wife and son. I just have to build my own guanxi network slowly here and, in the meantime, hope that things will change in Xian.”

While we were talking, he received a phone call from a university in Xian inviting him to talk to their students on “College students’ entrepreneurship.” They wanted to use him as a success story to inspire their students facing a difficult job market. I told him the invitation was encouraging, and that at least some people recognized his achievement. 

“I just wish the recognition came from the companies and government officials we deal with,” Zhang said. “I wish they understood how hard it is for us entrepreneurs. But they do not care. All they care about is making money for themselves.”

Li Bin was on the quiet side. He nodded knowingly. His company too was facing a crisis. China Mobile, his biggest client, just passed a rule that would disqualify his company from entering bids. Li Bin worried he would go out of business and counted on Zhang Sui to use his influence to change the situation for him. 

I now understood why they took a day off to “entertain” Lihui and me. Their company’s survival depended on effective guanxi and they were leaving no stone unturned, currying Zhang Sui’s favor through Lihui and me.  

After being dropped off at the hotel, I asked Lihui if Li Bin and Zhang Jian’s businesses were in such trouble, why couldn't they just scale back a little? Libin drove an expensive Lexus SUV, and Zhang Jian carried a LV men’s purse. 
“Because they must keep up their mianzi at all cost,” Lihui said. “If they appeared poor, nobody would deal with them.” 

On the flight from Nanjing to Xian, I sat next to a man who worked for a solar power company. With the government controlling the utility industry, he told me competition was fierce in his field with huge overproduction. Before entering the Qinghai market, they spent six months building guanxi. The only way they could get contracts was through officials’ children. But in the end, the officials’ children pocketed the lion’s share of the profits and his company got crumbs. Still, to survive they had to continue to do projects on these bad terms. 

Some American scholarship I have read claims that China is becoming more rule-governed (like the west) and less reliant on guanxi networks to conduct business.  But every Chinese entrepreneur I asked told me guanxi in China is as important as ever. But people were getting more rational cashing in on guanxi by insisting on minimum quality requirements on the goods and services provided. Nonetheless all things equal, it was still guanxi that determined who won and who lost in the marketplace. 

*****
After another night of banqueting, we went to a KTV. I wanted to experience the KTV hostesses I have read so much about but because Lihui and I were present, Qing Li chose a KTV without hostesses. Qing Li rented a private suite the size of a small movie theatre and had more drinks and snacks piled up in front of us. Zhang Sui was falling over drunk. When he went to the restroom, Yang Xu had to accompany him. Like a wounded soldier, Zhang put his arm around Yang Xu’s shoulder and leaned on him heavily. I understood why Qing Li asked Yang Xu to come along on the trip. Even though Yang Xu’s title on the business card was sales manager, he really was a glorified runner to take care of all the dirty work so Qing Li as the host did not have to get his hands dirty. 

The only women present were Lihui and me. I knew I intrigued the men at the banquet by the way they looked at me. I was “foreign,” attractive, and young looking. But they were careful not to approach me. Some of them talked to me after we got to the KTV. But even after many drinks, they remained respectful and reserved towards me. I came to understand I was insulated from any untoward advances because Zhang was the alpha male of the group and I was his sister-in-law. It reinforced my understanding that men’s exploitation of women, be it keeping ernai/xiaosan or sexual harassment in the workplace, was a matter of power not desire. However desirable a woman or lustful a man, it was a man’s feeling of power over her that gave him the audacity to objectify her. Without that power, he was more likely to keep his distance. What kept me from being pawed on that evening was my being part of Zhang’s retinue. The tradeoff for a woman seeking the protection of a powerful male was to come to his “inside,” to become his wife, mistress or “sister.” As Zhang’s girlfriend, Lihui was not only protected among the men, but elevated to “god mother” status. She was revered by all of Zhang’s “brothers” in his network seeking favors. She exercised influence over Zhang’s resources to help Cancan and my family. And for his own mianzi, Zhang clad Lihui in expensive clothes, diamonds, and furs. 

But I was well aware of the price Lihui paid for these privileges. Her life was far from glamorous. She was Zhang’s glorified personal secretary and nurse. He controlled her time and whereabouts. He dragged her to endless banquets in smoky rooms as arm candy for public appearances. Even if she chose to stay back for some peace and quiet, she still had to wait up for an inebriated Zhang to return at two in the morning and nurse his drunkenness. 
“I had not had one night good sleep on this trip and I am exhausted. It is always like this on trips with him. I dread these trips,” Lihui complained to me. 

I felt for my sister and asked her to come to sleep in my room.
 “I can’t. Zhang Sui needs me. With his heart problem, he is afraid to sleep alone,” Lihui said. 

I wanted to ask Lihui to tell Zhang to go to hell, but I knew she couldn’t. Although being in Zhang’s “inside” is taxing, being “outside” without Zhang’s protection was perilous.   

*****
The next morning we left for Hua Mountain. Li Bin drove Zhang Sui, Lihui and me up in the morning and Qing Li and others came in different cars in the afternoon. Officials from local China Mobile office waited in their car for hours on the roadside to greet us and act as our local guides. They hosted lunch and paid for everyone’s hotel in Hua Mountain. 

But I was wrong to think that the trip to Hua Mountain was a getaway from business and the city. A gang of ten came from Xian but only Lihui and I climbed Hua Mountain the next day. A manager from China mobile local office was instructed to accompany Lihui and me and to make sure we have a good time. He hired us a tour guide, paid for the entrance and lift tickets, and carried an expensive Canon camera to take photos for us. The poor guy was out of shape and ran out of breath after climbing the first flight of steps. Lihui and I asked him to wait for us at the foot of the mountain while the two of us climbed the mountain with the tour guide. 

The rest of the gang did more banqueting. I did not understand why they had to drive all the way from Xian to Hua Mountain to drink. Why didn't they stay in Xian to banquet and send Lihui and me alone to climb Hua Mountain to save gas and time? 

But those men thought differently. Following us up all the way to Hua Mountain showed their sincere hospitality. They wanted to be here to make sure we were taken good care of. They also wanted to make new connections with the officials at the local China mobile office for future business opportunities. 
Of all the people who chose banqueting instead of climbing Hua Mountain, Qing Li surprised me the most. He had expressed envy for my travels and told me how much he loved hiking and backpacking. But after driving hours and coming to the foothills of one of the most beautiful mountains in China, he chose to sit in a smoky banquet to drink. 

Lihui explained Qing Li to me: He is under lots of pressure to get his business going. His mind is not focused on playing. He has to worry about making money first before he can enjoy himself. 

“But the guy is already rich. He has a billion Yuan business,” I said. 
“It does not matter,” Lihui replied, ‘Nobody in China has any sense of security. Things can change anytime.” She told me wealthy businessmen with multi billion Yuan businesses were put in jail with their assets confiscated, either because of “local protectionism” or because they had offended some officials. 

****

I met Zhang Jun at the first banquet after we arrived in Xian. He was the director of the anti-corruption bureau in Xian. The fact I was “American” and writing a book made him nervous. With caution he answered some of my questions about his job after Lihui reassured him that I would not get him in trouble with the Chinese government. 

Even though the anti-corruption policy came from the central and provincial government, his bureau reported to the local government (Xian city). The city government controlled their finance, administrative and human resource functions, and they were not authorized to investigate officials higher in rank than them. For example, if someone came to Zhang and reported the mayor for corruption, he was not authorized to do anything. This made the anti-corruption bureau something of a travesty.

Zhang Jun said his bureau handled hundreds of corruption cases annually in Xian region. I asked him whether the corrupt officials had ernais. He said many of them did, and often it was the reason why they accepted bribes, because their low salaries could not cover the financial demands their ernais put on them.  

I could tell Zhang Jun was nervous talking to me. He did not want to turn me down because of Zhang Sui’s mianzi, but he also did not want to share anything he thought might get him in trouble with the Party. I let him off the hook and changed the subject. 

I met Zhang Jun again at the last banquet before we left Xian. Knowing his reservations to talk about his job, I did not ask him more questions, but observed him closely during the banquet. 

Liu Yong, the head of the China mobile Xian office, told him they were under tremendous pressure to beat their competitors: Unicom and Chinese Telecom. All three were state owned enterprises. As part of the “Socialism with Chinese characteristics,” the Chinese government forced big state owned monopolies to compete to stay efficient, and at the same time to give consumers more options. As a result, employees of these companies were hard pressed to meet high quotas.

Xian, after Beijing, has the most universities and colleges in China. Liu Yong told Zhang Jun that the China mobile Xian office aimed to have 80% of college students in Xian as users. But with Unicom as a fierce competitor, they faced a great challenge. 

Zhang Jun smiled confidently and said: “This is easy. I will talk to the Head of the college entrance admission office in Xian and have him stuff a china mobile card with a cell number in the admission packets of every student entering university in Xian.” 

Liu Yong’s face lit up. He toasted Zhang Jun and thanked him profusely. But he was worried that the Head of the Xian college admission office would be hard to reach. 

“Do not worry,” Zhang Jun said: “If I ask him to talk to you, he dare not ignore you.”  

Zhang Jun was right. Everybody was afraid of the anti-corruption bureau because sooner or later corrupt officials, if found out, would be sent to the bureau for investigation. Zhang Jun could determine whether they went to jail or were let free. With this power, if he asked an official to do something, the official would probably oblige. 

This answered the question I asked Zhang Jun when I met him the first time two days ago: “Are people from the anti-corruption bureau corrupted?”  
My question made Zhang uneasy and he evaded answering it using a double negative: “I can’t say that some people who work for anti-corruption bureau are not corrupted.” 

If Zhang Jun used his power to gain unfair market shares for China Mobile, he had to be rewarded in some way. Maybe nothing tangible and immediate. But if Zhang Jun needed a favor from Liu Young in the future, Liu would be sure to help. This is how Guanxi worked in China. It is an investment and a currency. One can stockpile it for the future. The more one accumulated indebtedness from others, the more mianzi and more power he has. Zhang Jun had been to two banquets with us the past three days. What was in it for him? 

*****
Later that evening Lihui and I went to the hotel spa to get a facial and a massage. Even though the hotel was rated five-star, the spa was nothing more than a massage parlor. The female masseuses in attendance informed us that they did not give facials even though it was a service item on the spa menu. She explained: “We do not have any product for facials because most of our clients are male and they usually call us to their rooms for massages.” 
I asked them whether male guests approached them for sexual services. They looked at each other to determine whether to tell the truth. The more outspoken one told me sometimes but the hotel forbade them from doing anything. Most men brought prostitutes from outside. I had seen scantily dressed young women in the hotel lobby and breakfast buffet and the hotel placed condom packets in the bathroom for sale. China was the only country where I had seen condoms for sale in hotel rooms. There must be a demand for it. 

After the girls felt sure we were not undercover police, they relaxed and became chattier. They told us they were from the Xian area but most masseuses were from the rural areas or outlying cities because being a masseuse was often associated with sexual services. I asked them what they thought of women being ernais and whether they knew any. They told me a woman who used to work there became an ernai. With both disdain and envy they told her story: “Her man took her to Beijing, bought her an apartment, a car and promised to take her abroad. And she is not even pretty and does not have good aura. She was lucky.”

 *****

The evening before our departure, Qing Li bought me an expensive bracelet and Lihui a watch as gifts. Lihui told me he had spent close to one hundred thousand Yuan on Zhang Sui since last year on hotels, banquets, gifts, KTV, spa (for Lihui and me), and travel. But so far, no deals had been made.  For his business to continue to succeed he had to continue to buy guanxi. Besides money, he and his assistant spent lots of time entertaining people like Zhang Sui and acted like servants to them. Even though he praised Zhang Sui to Lihui and me and called him “brother sui," I wondered how he truly felt about a man on whom he had spent so much money, who bullied his employee, and had not brought any profit for his business. I suspected he felt the same way doing all this as the entrepreneurs who accompanied me sightseeing -- there was “no other way.” I regretted not having an opportunity to talk to him about his true feelings and thoughts. But I also knew Qing Li was savvy, and probably would not reveal anything negative to me about Zhang Sui. 

At breakfast the next morning, before we left for the airport Zhang Sui told me Qing Li kept a twenty-one year old college student in Xian as ernai. They had been together for a couple of years. 

I almost fell off my chair. Of all the men I met on this trip, Qing Li would be the last man I would suspect to have an ernai. He seemed so sensible and modest. He showed a spiritual side when he expressed longings to travel to faraway places and hike in the wilderness. He seemed to love and respect his wife who was young and attractive, and they worked together on his business. Why would he keep an ernai?

I asked Zhang Sui whether Qing Li’s wife knew. Zhang Sui told me no. She lived in Nanjing and the girl in Xian. Even though Qing Li brought the girl around the banquets sometimes, no one was going to tell his wife. Chinese men believed “Brothers are like limbs and wives like clothes.” Loyalty to a “brother” superseded loyalty to a wife. It was a male honor code.

I asked where the girl was from, how they met, and the terms of their arrangement. Zhang said he did not know because Qing never talked about it and nobody ever asked him. But everybody accepted it. 

“What is the fuss? Keeping ernai is common and many of my other ‘brothers’ keep ernai. Zhang Bing (the mafia boss) keeps hundreds of college students. These days, college students are not worth much,” Zhang Sui said sipping his tea. 

*****
Both Qing Li and Zhang Jian told me Zhang Sui was the legendary “Big Brother” across both black and white society in Xuzhou. Even the head of the mafia in Xuzhou, Zhang Bing, revered him. I had heard Lihui talk about Zhang Sui’s extensive guanxi network before and I wanted to know more. Lihui later told me that Zhang Sui had extensive guanxi in the government, military, and the police. His father was a Red Army soldier who later became a high official in the military. Zhang had used his guanxi to spring black society members from jail and earned their gratitude. I asked Lihui how Zhang felt about using unjust means to help criminals get away. Lihui said the mianzi he got from it outweighed the tug of his conscience. 

Lihui told me Zhang Sui was not the only one who was connected with the White and the Black society. In fact, the White and Black society in China worked together inseparably. When the government needed people to do dirty work such as bullying people off their property during Demolition and Re-establishment, they hired the black society hooligans; and in turn, when those hooligans broke the law, they turned to the police for protection. The black society had become such a problem, like corruption itself, that the Chinese government set up “Anti-black” offices at various levels of government to address the issue. But it had become a losing battle because not only could black society members, like Zhang Bing, buy his way into legitimate society; legitimate society was constantly living under the taint of corruption. I read in the news how the head of the Anti-black office in Chongqing had recently been arrested for corruption. When the white hats chasing the black hats are discovered to be wearing black hats too, who any longer can tell black from white? 

In a just society, the rule of law applies equally to all citizens. In an unjust society, the law exempts the privileged. This leaves the wronged unprotected. To settle scores and seek protection, the disadvantaged resort to extra-legal means, like the black society. Men drink and bribe their way into the networks of brotherhoods. But these pathways are closed to women. When young women trade in their bodies, they believe they are taking agency as an alternative to passivity or fatalism.

The women in these guanxi networks crossing white and black society are called “gray women.” Gray women are routinely used in business transactions as lubricant, to sell, to bribe and to deal. They are part of an elaborate “beauty economy” that includes not only ernai and xiaosan but high-end service women who are carefully trained in the art of feminine charm and flirtation to sell upscale goods and services to men. They were a new phenomenon emerging out of China’s post reform era. 

The week’s banqueting opened my eyes to Zhang’s complex relations with the black and the white society and how Lihui played the role of a gray woman. I had migrated to America while she stayed in China, but as women we had faced the same predicament. During my Americanization, I had experienced firsthand how women were held back, exploited, and commoditized, especially after I started my business in Orange County. 

## Chapter 24            Beauty Has Thin Fate 

After mixing further with American society, I stood out in a way that surprised me: My looks. Chinese people idealized the western standard of female beauty--big eyes with the double crease, high nose bridge, curvaceous figure, and alabaster skin. I never thought Americans would find me, olive–skinned, black-haired and ultra slim, attractive. When I worked for an engineering firm after graduating W&J, I felt men’s eyes tracking me everywhere in the office. Male colleagues lingered around my cubicle to chat, to help, and invite me to lunch. 

When the company was building a new office building, I had to walk each day by the construction site to my office. The construction workers smiled and waved at me and I smiled and waved back. One day coming back from lunch, I noticed a group of my coworkers gathered to look at the new building. I stopped to join them. The crowd silenced as I approached them. I looked upward to the second story steel beam. Someone had spray painted, “Lily Rules!!!”
The construction workers must have painted it, but how did they know my name? And more importantly, what did it mean? I understood “Rule” meant to control and regulate, but what did it have to do with me? I quietly asked a trusted colleague and he explained to me: It is American slang for “you are awesome.” It also means you are the most beautiful girl in the office; which gives you the power to dominate.”

I was too embarrassed to probe further, but nonetheless felt flattered. I was not sure I merited the attention, but for an immigrant who felt powerless and out of place, power and domination sounded good to me. 

After I became single and more active socially, I learned the power of beauty. I discovered a little attractiveness and friendliness could go a long way. They brought special treatment and opened doors. If I smiled at a restaurant waiter and complimented the food, he gave me a half a cake to take home. When I did not have enough coins for the parking meter, the parking attendant disconnected the meter so I would not get ticketed. At a bar when I told a chiropractor I loved foot massages, he knelt on the floor to massage my feet. I had my wishes fulfilled on demand without lifting a finger. All I had to do was smile. 

Male attention flattered my ego but I did not take it seriously. Men who indulged me were looking for a date. Most of the time I was uninterested. My eyes were on professional advancement and partying and dating were not going to get me there. To climb the career ladder, I left the small engineering firm I worked for and joined a more prestigious multi-national engineering firm. I enrolled in a part time MBA program and hoped an advanced degree would yield bigger opportunities and a higher salary. I shifted from party scenes to professional networks, attended business events, and sought professional connections and mentors.  

I soon found out men approached women the same way in professional settings as in clubs. The difference was the consequences. In a club, a woman could turn a guy down with little thought; but in a professional setting, my rebuffing a teacher or a superior had repercussions. An accounting professor at my MBA program paid me special attention. When I snubbed his advances, he failed me, though I had a bachelor’s degree in accounting and had aced my other classes. When my boss at the engineering firm “fell in love” with me, he dropped in my lap alluring opportunities for advancement and took me on business trips. But his favoritism was so blatant the company management fired him and laid me off shortly after.

My friend Holly advised me to cut my long hair and “tone down” my “babe look” to be “taken more seriously” and avoid further “trouble with men.” But my body and hair were mine and I wanted to dress and look the way I wanted. I was educated and capable, why shouldn’t I be taken seriously? How were the indiscretions of some deluded men my responsibility? 

Other friends advised me to sue the school for harassment and the company for unfair dismissal. But I couldn’t bring myself to ruining a man’s family and career. After all, I had known these men and in some cases befriended them. Turning on them felt like a betrayal. With the Bill Clinton sex scandal dominating the news, I couldn’t sympathize with these women any more than I could sympathize with Bill. These were adult women who knew what they were doing and now played the victim card for publicity, notoriety, and money. America was said to be the most litigious country in the world. People did not take responsibility for burning their lips on hot coffee or dropping frozen chicken on their feet. They sought to make others pay and to become rich off it. And America had plenty of lawyers willing to drum up such greed. The “victim mentality” repulsed me. To sue these men was to stay involved in their drama and to admit their power to harm me. I wanted only to move on with my life. I believed bigger and better things awaited me. All I had to do was build my professional networks and stay poised for new opportunities. I was positive I could impress people with my capability and earnestness and that doors would open for me.  

*****
I met the owner and president of a Pittsburgh food company Robert when I was graduating Katz and looking for a job. No jobs came out of that meeting. Robert instead started to pursue me. He was twenty years older with thinning hair and I couldn’t fathom why he thought I would be interested in him. Even if I could overlook his age and appearance, I couldn’t overlook his seedy reputation and philandering. He treated his employees so shabbily that one shot him. He told me while his first wife was pregnant and grieving over the death of her father he cheated on her with a Chilean bombshell half his age. He eventually divorced her and married the bombshell, Sandy.  In Robert’s own indelicate words, Sandy had “heavenly breasts” and offered him “sex on demand.” But it did not stop him from cheating on her too. When I asked him why he cheated on Sandy, he told me there were simply too many women throwing themselves at him. I assumed those women pursued Robert for his money, as had Sandy, who eventually divorced him for another rich man decades her senior. She had grown accustomed to luxury but couldn’t earn it on her own. I was never interested in Robert’s money. I was interested in his mentorship so I could make my own money. In business school, I was taught to seek out successful people for mentors. Robert was the president of an international firm; for sure he could teach me a few things. 

Robert used to invite me to YPO and WPO  events at the exclusive Duquesne Club. I was always eager to attend because successful business people congregated at those events. I went around the room introducing myself to people I admired in business, almost all men, trying to make business contacts. What I didn’t realize at the time was these men did not see me as a professional woman but as Robert’s date. In hindsight, with Robert’s reputation as a womanizer, they probably thought I was one of his “girls” latching onto him for money. The fact the other women in attendance were all wives or girlfriends undoubtedly strengthened that perception. At one dinner, the wife of a wealthy businessman seated next to me joked how her husband treated her like a glorified housekeeper at home, and when they came to the Duquesne Club, she had to walk paces behind him. 

“But at least I am allowed to set foot in the Duquesne Club,” she said. “Twenty years ago, women were not even allowed.” 

I found no humor in her jokes. Yes women were now allowed on the premises, but mostly as companions or ornaments to men. They were no closer to puncturing the old boy’s network than before.

Another friend Bill, who lived in the penthouse of my building, was a successful businessman and philanthropist of wealth and influence. I appreciated his brilliant mind and befriended him. He owned businesses across the globe and had a thriving medical company in Pittsburgh I was interested in joining after graduating Katz. But Bill had no interest in hiring me. He wanted to sleep with me. Having me as an employee would only complicate things. He told me he lusted after one of his receptionists but dared not move in on her because of the workplace complications. But when she quit her job and became a stripper, Bill rushed to patronize her at her club. Though a respected businessman and civic leader, Bill frequented strips clubs and paid for sex. And when he tired of buying sex, he hunted for it in bars and clubs. Dangling his wealth, he routinely turned professional women into bootie calls. When I turned down his advances, he called me a “dragon lady.” 

My friends would say to me: “Other women fall at the feet of those rich men; you brush them aside like bristles to lint. I admire your independence.” My friends gave me too much credit. I was not immune to the lure of money. Nor was I morally superior. I had learned that “rich” and “poor” were relative terms. When I left my middle class suburban life and joined the single crowd, my peers were unestablished young people. I felt “rich” among them. But entering the successful professional circle, I became increasingly aware of my limited means. I felt the temptation of wealth just as the women who threw themselves at rich men. I was not above feeling envy. I simply did not find most of these men attractive. The thought of getting involved with a man I did not find attractive for money was repulsive and humiliating. Wouldn’t that make me a prostitute? I had come from poor China, but I was educated and had a professional job -- for sure I did not need to sell myself to eat. How arrogant were these men to assume they could buy me? 

But I understood how they thought. They had bought many women before me. Why not me? No matter how old, uncouth, and unattractive the man, money was the all-purpose steroid for his masculinity. They believed they could manipulate and exploit without consequence. Often they did not even have to dish out a penny. Flaunting their money was enough. Men of average means had much to prove, and often spent money they didn’t have to impress women. Feeling they had little to prove, many wealthy men acted miserly and expected red carpet treatment for free. I had read books written by wealthy entrepreneurs who gave tips on using fear tactics to exact steep discounts and freebies at luxury resorts. They believed they were “too rich to pay.” Vaunting their wealth, they demanded special treatment for their future business; and fearing losing them as customers, service staff would often capitulate. The same tactics worked on women. Seduced by the whiff of money and afraid to displease, women would throw themselves at such men for free. 

My MD friend Amy was Bill’s bootie call girl for a year, dropping everything to sleep with him in his apartment when he texted late at night. He never took her out on a date nor bought her dinner. She paid her own gas driving there. By the end of the year Amy came to cry on my shoulders. I asked her why she never asked Bill to take her out. Amy told me she wanted to prove to Bill that she was a MD, not a gold digger like Bill’s other women. “But he still treated me like a prostitute,” Amy said, tearing up. 

I did not have the heart to tell Amy prostitutes were treated better. They got paid. I had seen Bill giving large tips to strippers at strip clubs. Amy must have hoped her catering to Bill’s whims free of charge would land him as a husband, while Bill simply took Amy up on her eagerness. 

These men used their monetary advantage to play the upper hand with women of lesser means. But when dealt with women of equal or superior wealth, they treaded more cautiously. Old Robert with thinning hair and a sleazy reputation pursued young, beautiful and educated women with audacity. But when he was introduced to a woman of greater wealth, his confidence vanished. Stripped of the economic advantage, he became insecure and self-conscious. The first time he visited her in her New York apartment, he told me, he circled her block three times before summoning the courage to knock on her door. 

I had learned since a young age that those at the top skim the cream of life and those on bottom scavenge crumbs. I recalled mother’s hurt when father’s family looked down upon her because our family was poor. I recalled the insecurity of being a new immigrant from poor China among “rich” Americans. Nothing angered me more than inequality and the presumption that I should know my place and be content there.

The rich men who pursued me sometimes were twenty to thirty years older with a checkered past. With their money, they might think they were offering me a sweet deal. Yet I knew if another philandering man their age offered their daughters the same deal, they would go ballistic. If the deal was not good enough for their daughters, why was it good enough for me? The more these men courted me, the more it made me angry. They did not pursue me out of love or equality but lust and arrogance. If I rolled over for them solely because they were rich and I was not, I would have admitted I deserved the rotten deal they were dishing me. 

Besides money, the fact I was Asian contributed to why some American men sized me up an easy target. After delving further into American culture, I started to pick up the connotations that surrounded “Asian woman,” and realized not all of them flattering. Besides the stereotype of a submissive woman the phrase conjured, it was often linked with the sexual fantasies of American males. On popular American pornographic sites, “Asian women” was a major category sharing prominent screen space with “teens,” “hardcore,” and “big tits.” Asian women were particularly stereotyped for being undiscriminating in their sexual appetites, willing to bed the fat, the ugly, and the elderly.  I suspected this stereotype resulted from the sex industry in poor Asian countries like Thailand where poor women slept with men for pocket change.

And Americans, undiscerning of one Asian country from another, lumped all Asian women together. A male friend confided in me an “Asian women” joke spread among his male friends and over the Internet: “Asian women’s vaginas open horizontally.” Another male friend dated one Asian woman after another, all hairdressers, restaurant waitresses, and masseuses who barely spoke English. I assumed these women’s lack of education and means made him feel superior. Many men told me they loved my “exoticness,” which they expected me to take as a compliment. But I couldn’t help thinking that “exotic” was a word to describe a flower, a car, or a pet. Labeling a woman “exotic” annihilated everything that made her human. “Asian Women” had become an American invention, like General Tso’s Chicken and Fortune Cookies in Chinese restaurants. And I had to live with all the myth, stigma, and expectations that came with it. 

Even if I could attribute my anger and defensiveness towards these men to my immigrant experience, I could not get over the simple sexism behind it. I did not see these men approaching women twenty years older than they and unattractive. They must have assumed that simply being a woman, I deserved less -- the very Neanderthal thinking I thought I had escaped leaving China. 

I recalled the hurt I felt when mother favored Shiguang over me. Years later when mother came to visit me in America, she repeated the same favoritism. Only this time it was with my husband Tom. At dinner she routinely served Tom first and dished him more and better cuts of meat and fish. I didn’t care about the food nor did I blame Tom. I knew Tom loved me and always put me first. But I could not help feeling a pang knowing mother was repeating her old pattern by putting a man first, before her daughter and herself. I saw how women like Amy, Sandy, and Robert’s ex wife were used and abused by men. I told myself I would never allow that to happen to me. I would never tolerate sexism. 

No matter how I spun it - economic disparity, racism or sexism-- I confronted inequality. I grew up on a communist ideology that taught me to expect equality, but China failed to deliver it. I came to America to seek it but America too disappointed me. My anger turned me into a female avenger seeking justice for all women exploited by men. I started a one-woman crusade to put rapacious men in their place. My weapon was my attractiveness and their desire for me. I wanted them to experience the same humiliation and powerlessness they had subjected other women to. Years later, I realized the delusion behind my self -appointed “mission.” I could not put a dent on the ego of these men nor could I deter them from exploiting other women. I was Don Quixote tilting at windmills. 

There is a Chinese saying: “Beauty has thin fate.” It means beautiful women usually do not end up well. Because men covet them and want to keep them as property. Sometimes these women bring unlucky fate upon themselves. They based their worth on their beauty and relied on men for an easy life. When their beauty faded, they were often discarded.

I never thought I was beautiful growing up. I do not think so in my adulthood. But since American men found me exotic and being an “attractive woman” had become part of my identity in America, I had to deal with the consequences of being “beautiful.” But I knew beautiful or not, I would do everything in my power to avoid the “thin fate” imposed on a beautiful woman. I would rely on no one emotionally or financially and always keep my independence. I would work to become as rich as the men who sought to control me. 

*****

Few women were at the top, and the few who were had no interest in helping me. Powerful men would offer to help me to curry favor. But at the end of day, they had no incentive to mentor me to success. They wanted someone they could rescue and control. My success would erase their advantage. Their promises to help usually fizzled into hints to bed or wed me, and I could not help feeling cornered and resentful. Repeatedly I was promised the moon, only to have the offer taken off the table after I “rejected” him. I came to understand that the “free gifts” from a conniving man often turned out the most costly. It was best I find a way to succeed on my own. The arrogance of these men spurred me on. Coming to know some of them up close, I saw they were far from the admirable role models I learned about in business school. Many of them were unscrupulous, greedy, and uncouth. They might be intelligent and resourceful but I knew that if I applied myself I was just as capable. 

But the road to success is dotted with obstacles. After I gradated Katz and worked for a Fortune 500 firm for a year, I was disheartened by its suffocating hierarchy, bureaucracy, and cliquishness. The company operated like a dictatorship and demanded its employees be “team players,” a euphemism for accepting “group think” and swallowing rampant inequality. Top managers occupied spacious offices with windows overlooking the skyline while workers crammed into windowless cubicles. But even with their plush offices, the managers often opted to work flex hours from home while average workers were monitored and reprimanded for returning from lunch a few minutes late. Each employee was assigned tasks with no consideration of her special aptitudes and interests. I detested the regimentation.

Disappointed in the corporate environment, I began looking for an alternative route to success. Meeting John in Palomino’s, a downtown Pittsburgh bar two months after 9/11, was serendipitous, but becoming an entrepreneur seemed a destined step on my path. Elbowing his way through swarms of men, John told me his life story in snippets: He grew up in Pittsburgh and was back visiting his family. He had moved to California eighteen years ago, started his own business, lived on an island, and had a boat. That random Friday night meeting started a long distance friendship which years later turned into a business partnership that promised to free me from corporate America.

*****
After our first meeting, John and I talked for hours daily on the phone. Despite our different upbringings and life experiences, John and I shared much. He understood my frustration working for large corporations and had achieved something I aspired to achieve –financial independence with his own business. We compared notes on the partying scenes of Pittsburgh and Orange County. He told me if I thought these Pittsburgh sleazes dazzled young women with their wealth, men in Orange County were a hundred times worse. Orange County was filled with old rich lechers and young gold diggers. 

Two weeks after we met, I visited John in Newport Beach for Thanksgiving and he gave me a whirlwind tour of the wealth and glamor of Orange County. He took me to work out in his gym where every member had a personal trainer. He “cruised” me around in his boat and pointed out the owners of the grandest yacht in the harbor. He took me to posh clubs where the rich and the beautiful hung out. He pointed out an Asian woman at the bar with stupendous boobs and told me she once lived a princess lifestyle funded by her ex-boyfriend. When she wanted to ski, he rented her a whole ski resort in Switzerland and flew her there on his private jet. But the fairy tale ended after only six months when he dumped her for a younger model. 

I first thought John told me those things to impress me. But after getting to know him better, I realized that eighteen years of Orange Country living had not slackened John’s fascination for the California glam. He told me no matter how hard a day he had in the office, when he drove home to the island with the sunset over the harbor, he knew he had it made. He told me whenever he returned to Pittsburgh, he felt he was stumbling back into a third world country. To his childhood friends who stayed in Pittsburgh, he was the cool California dude who lived a lifestyle they could only dream of. 

John marveled at my drive and my ambition – “full of piss and vinegar” as he put it. And more than that, John applauded me for not taking the easy way out by marrying a rich suitor. He told me about the Orange County “bag ladies” who used to be hot girlfriends of rich men. After their men dumped them for a younger model, they had neither the schooling nor skills to make it on their own. They fell into poverty and the only vestiges of their former lives were the expensive designer bags their boyfriends bought them.

Though attracted to me, John did not pursue me for a romantic relationship. His Catholic upbringing had taught him sex was sinful and dirty. Worried that sex would cheapen our friendship, John opted to become a supportive big brother to me. Often feeling besieged by men hitting on me, I found John’s reserve with me a breath of fresh air. Unlike most men I knew, John saw beyond my attractiveness to my talent and drive; and he understood something other men didn’t: To love Lily was to support her independence and help her grow her wings. John would say to me: “You are a wild stallion. Any man who tries to trap you will get kicked in the balls and he deserves it.” I knew in John I had found a friend and ally I could trust, and I loved him for it. 

*****
After running his telecom business for fifteen years, John sold out to his partners in 2004 for a handsome sum, and started looking for new and bigger opportunities. For centuries, the West had been lured by the mysterious “Far East.” But over the last twenty years, China’s expanding economy had added to that lure making China the new paradise for capitalist adventurers. John always prided himself on his entrepreneurial vision, the ability to see gold where others saw coal. He became one of these wild-eyed fortune seekers looking to join the Chinese gold rush and deemed me a perfect conduit. And in John I saw a partner who could help me free myself from patronizing rich men and the oppressive corporate environment. I wanted to succeed on my own and saw having my own business as key to it. My relationship with John deepened into a trusted friendship and we came to see our futures as intertwined. He believed he could help me realize my dream and I could help him realize his.

In 2004, after some research John and I started a business to import contemporary Chinese art to America. We were encouraged by the market potential, high profit margins, and the inherent prestige of art dealing. We went to China together to do market research, find artists, and buy art. A month after we returned to America, John and I opened an art gallery in Laguna Beach. 

## Chapter 25           Once upon a Gallery 

Compared to “conservative” Pittsburghers, Californians seemed more open to taking risks and less constrained by convention. Even the homeless people seemed to have more fun in OC. In Pittsburgh, homeless men stood in the street in the sub-zero weather, looking cold and haggard. In Orange County, blonde surfer dudes sat in street corners begging for change while whistling at pretty girls. If I thought Americans were more light-hearted than Chinese, people in OC were perpetual adolescents, spoiled by ceaseless good weather, surf and sun, and inflated real estate.

With a business in Orange County, I experienced John’s California dream and was seduced by it daily. I loved waking up to birds chirping, water swishing, the smell of eucalyptus on sun baked sidewalks, and warm sunlight peeking through the window shades, especially during the winter months when Pittsburgh was cold and dreary. I loved the ocean and the sand, and fresh fruit and flowers year round. Every morning John and I kayaked in the harbor, or ran on the beach. I embraced all that California leisure had to offer: tennis and golf and surfing and skiing; I became a connoisseur of wine and food; I started to travel extensively. An American passport gave me access to the globe. Friends marveled at my “zest for life.” I was into everything and would try anything. They did not know I was working overtime to make up for my childhood deprivation. 

*****   
On the morning of the opening of Wang Niandong show, I lay in bed and relished a moment of leisure before diving into the busy day ahead of me. I had been out with Steve the night before and could still feel my overindulgence in a piquant 1975 Bordeaux. I went over the day’s schedule in my head. John and I had an appointment with his personal trainer Ken at 10am; at noon I had a lunch with Andrea, the editor of Laguna Beach Independent; and following that was a microdermabrasion at Christine’s house in Newport Coast; the last minute preparations at the gallery before the opening at 7pm, and the after party at Hush starting God knows when. 

Spying me entering the gym with John and hiding under my baseball cap, Ken shook his finger at me in a mock reprimand, “You are late again princess.” And with a sly smile, Ken continued: “Out partying with Steve on his stretchy Yacht I bet…” 

“Shut up,” I banter back half annoyed, “It is none of your business.”  I had gotten used to Ken’s obnoxious remarks and learned to parry his every thrust. 
Mid mornings are busy times at the gym. People who work out here either do not work or do not work regular hours. They make their appearance at all hours of the day in their Bentleys, Ferraris, and Rolls Royces and promenade into the gym with bodies as young and hard as nature bestows or money can buy. 

While following Ken around from machine to machine, I notice I am the only woman wearing no make-up. All the other women look like they checked in for serious hair and make-up before working out. I look at these women and wonder to myself: “What is the point of sprucing before sweating?” But I already know the answer to my question.  Most women who come here are on one of two missions that require looking perfect to accomplish. They are either “kept” women who don’t wish to be dumped for a younger model; or they are unattached and looking to hook up to a rich man. In Orange County, the capital of plastic surgeries in the United States, beauty and youth have sticker prices. These women are not the only ones who work out with an intention. John made many business contacts at the gym from rubbing elbows with the moneyed crowd. 
“Come here princess,” Ken calls out, while motioning with his forefinger for me to follow him. 

I follow.  Ken smiles slyly and sings tauntingly:

“See, I can make you come with one finger.” 

I shake my head and roll my eyes in mock disgust. I have grown accustomed to Ken’s sexual innuendos and pay him no mind. While Ken annoys me to no end, I also understand he acts like a juvenile to exact his revenge. Everyone in the OC keeps score. You know whether you are a 10 or 2 on looks, homes, cars, bank accounts--on any measure that tracks status. And your number determines your prospects with the opposite sex. Ken knows – or so I think – that he has no chance with any woman who comes to this gym. He is a Chevy owner who works in a Ferraris showroom. I almost root for Ken at times, as one would root for a small dog barking futilely at a big dog’s juicy but forbidden bone. 

*****
At noon I met Andrea on the rooftop of Hotel La Casa Del Camino for lunch. La Casa Del Camino sits on the beach off the South Coast Highway, across the street from the gallery. It is another perfect day in Laguna Beach. The Pacific Ocean is a shimmering azure under the bright California sun and the ocean breeze blunts the intensity of the midday heat. Sipping a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, I feel I am somewhere in the Mediterranean. 

The lunch is to thank Andrea for the write up in the paper for Wang Niandong’s opening tonight. But that is not the only reason. I feel a heartfelt affinity with Andrea, though, on first appearance, she and I would never be pegged to travel in the same circles. I am in my mid-thirties and often told I look 25 with my slim built and daredevil attitude. Andrea is in her mid-forties, with thin and stringy shoulder length hair, uncoiffed. Her soft-featured face is overshadowed by a retiring meekness. 

Despite her appearance, I find Andrea’s mind fascinating and her modesty comforting. I love diving into her soft grayish eyes and listening to her hold forth on art and publishing, a refreshing break from what most of my friends in Orange County talk about: food, wine, fitness, travel, and gossip, mostly of the who’s-sleeping-with-whom variety.

I probed Andrea on her career as a journalist and editor and thought of my childhood dreams of becoming a writer and poet with a tinge of loss. Then I reminded myself how much I love running the gallery. Though I had a MBA and worked for fortune 500 companies, I learned more about business from running the gallery. It taught me about sacrifice and resourcefulness; about responsibility and leadership. And most of all, it taught me about patience and calm in the face of uncertainty. Without the bureaucracy of a large corporation, I could use my creativity and make swift decisions. I loved helping Chinese artists make a name in the West and bringing Chinese art to America. We had made a name for ourselves as a premier Chinese gallery in Southern California and grew a substantial clientele and I was proud of it. I believed I had made the right choice becoming a business woman. 

*****

After waking up from a catnap, I went to Christine’s house for a microdermabrasion. Christine lives in a mansion in Newport Coast with her billionaire boyfriend Kurt, whose family owned a cement business. Christine is my age, with a slim built but a sexy booty and ample bosom. Her stylish long blond hair framed her baby doll face. Everything about Christine looks perfect: The porcelain skin, the chiseled nose, the arched eyebrows and the pouted lips. John told me Christine had a lot “done” to her: Her butt, her boobs, her lips and her nose. I did not take John’s words seriously. Christine turned John down when he pursued her because he was not rich enough. I suspect some of John’s picking apart Christine’s beauty was sour grapes. But whether she was molded by plastic surgeons or not, Christine’s beauty did create a distance. Despite her friendliness, she seemed guarded with her untouchable perfection. 

Since John gave up pursuing Christine, her beauty, artificial or real, meant nothing to him. John now saw her as a means to get close to money. He had been encouraging me to befriend Christine because he wanted me to dive in the OC scenes of the rich and the beautiful, two cult closely entwined. 

As I followed Christine through her mansion to the spa room, I felt mixed emotions. Kurt’s mansion was garish to the point of vulgarity. But I was nonetheless dazzled by its size and elaborate trappings. With its animal prints, shaggy rugs, exotic nudes, sprawling bars and pools and spas – and everything new--it felt like Hefner’s playboy mansion. While lying on the spa table with the buzzing sound of the dermabrasion, Christine chatted away. She told me they had just come back from Los Cabo in Kurt’s private jet. I thought of my five-hour coach flight from Pittsburgh to LAX. She showed me a pair of $2000 shoes from her latest shopping spree. I thought of my worry over the sales of the Wang Niandong exhibition. Christine’s only worry was to stay beautiful to keep Kurt happy. In her own words, she was “passionate about fitness and beauty” and aspired to have her own Spa someday. To learn the craft, she had purchased state of the art equipment, turned a room in the mansion into a spa, and practiced on friends like me. 

But even the life of a princess was not all honky dory. As much of a princess Christine looked to the world, I sensed her insecurities and bitterness. With all her expensive clothes, bags and shoes, her royal highness was a pampered servant to Kurt. Her only ambition in life was to please and keep him. She wanted to marry and have kids; Kurt was divorced with adult children and uninterested. Kurt traveled wherever and whenever he wanted for business or pleasure; when he did bring Christine along, she waited for him at home. 
“Kurt is the worst person to date,” Christine sighed, “He is never home and I never know where he is. He comes and goes as he pleases, but expects me to always be home.” 

Christine’s biggest insecurity came from her worry about aging. She knew Kurt’s affection depended on her beauty and that he could easily replace her with a younger model. All beauty fades but given the stakes, Christine held on to hers desperately. 

I tried to fathom living Christine’s life. I loved luxury and financial security as many women, and I had wealthy men pursuing me. Steve was not a billionaire but his wealth was enough to give me a life of a princess. I questioned whether I had made the right decision with my struggle to remain independent. But the thought of giving it up to  depend on a man not only terrified me but made me feel like a failure.

*****
The gallery was already buzzing with a crowd of people when I walked in at 7:15. For the evening, I had picked a sapphire blue silk evening gown. I like how it hugged my torso snuggly with a simple strap around my neck, and flowed from the hips down in a long train. In it I feel soft, feminine and free. Light Bosa Nova music played in the background. John wore a black suit with a violet front handkerchief and no tie. Tall and with all-American good looks, John’s posture was that of a confident entrepreneur. He held his shoulders square and protruded his chest like a proud host. He stood next to artist Wang Niandong and nodded attentively to the words of a flamboyant couple whom I reckon he has sized up as potential buyers. They lingered in front of Wang’s painting “The California Dream” -- a wall size painting with the backside of a young naked woman kneeling on a red leather sofa under the deep blue sea, and looking away from a wind surfer in the background skimming the surface. I exchanged a quick wink with Kimberly, a gallery employee, who was busy greeting people and serving them drinks. I ran a quick surveillance of Kimberly’s up done hair, dangling earrings, and tight-fitting black top with an elegant long skirt. The ensemble showcases her sexy long neck, ivory face and full cleavage. I smile a faint smile of approval – she had taken my instruction to heart on how to dress for the evening: “Elegance, aim for elegance, not just sexiness,” was my mantra to her and other gallery employees on how to dress for the art business.

I continue my scan of the gallery with satisfaction, pride, and the adrenaline of a second wind. It has been an intense few weeks of frantic scrambling to put the exhibition together. I can finally take a deep breath and enjoy a release of tension. The space looks fabulous and the art stunning. 

I love Wang’s art. His paintings intrigue and stir with feminine beauty, erotic energy, and symbolism. I named the exhibition “Urban Desire and Beyond.” As an art dealer, I relish the pleasure of naming exhibitions and paintings according to my own imagination. It satisfies my secret love affair with words. The paintings fall into two distinct series with connected themes. The “Underwater Series” employs the theme of the underwater as a background, with nude, half nude or elaborately dressed women in a surrealistic underwater setting. Each painting in the series projects in different ways how the underwater world is weightless, free floating and alluring; yet that world is also a cruel temptress, alienating, suffocating, and an illusion machine, forcing people up for breaths of the real and authentic. 

Through the symbolism of an aquatic environment that both inspires and chokes off freedom, Wang hints at the ambiguities of urban life in a rapidly changing China. The modern Chinese cities tantalize with economic freedom and opportunity but also oppress with crushing pressure and alienation.

If the “Underwater Series” limns the ambiguity of the Chinese cities, the “Butterfly Series” captures the Chinese people’ desire for freedom. It depicts transformation, a transition from cocoons to butterflies with wings to fly freely.  “Urban Desire” is part of the Butterfly Series and the eponymous piece of the show. The painting depicts a young Chinese woman against the urban sky, wearing only white thongs and garter belts, her luscious behind exposed; she is standing slightly bent forward with her back arching upward, larger than life. 

As the sun goes down outside the gallery windows, the interior lighting projected on Wang’s oversized paintings reaches its full effect. The gallery has disappeared and in its place floats a glittering world of fantasy, beauty, and sensuality in an endless dark sea.

*****

I walk around to greet people, smiling and paying everyone the appropriate attention while receiving assortments of cheerfulness, friendliness and admiration. A man grabs me by the arm and asks: “Who are you? You look like you own the place!”

“That is because I do,” I replied with a smile before stepping away.

I checked out the crowd and did a mental roll call of the types.  The “Gallerinas”, dressed to the nines, attend every opening and are well-practiced at fawning. They marvel at the art, try on the jewelries and have their photos taken but never buy anything. Their counterparts are the single guys who sniff around for some thrills. The “fixture” couples who come to see and be seen are chatty and friendly. They sometimes buy if they find something they love. To ignore them would be an unforgivable slight.

Then, there are the homeless beach bums wandering in for free food and drinks. They irked me at first but I came to accept them as part of the scene. This is Southern California and there is freedom of lifestyle for all, even those interlopers.

And, finally, there are what John calls the “heavy hitters”. These are the serious buyers and the bread and butter of our business. There is Kurt and Christine. There is Dr. Mel who sold his medical insurance company and is now living the good life of a retiree. And there is Chinese billionaire Frank Li and his wife Yuling. Heavy hitters command John’s and my special attention and get invitations to the private parties. 

As co-owner of the gallery with John and hostess of the event, everyone thinks it is my party and they make me the center of attention. Women lavish me with compliments on my looks, my dress, and the gallery. Men either ogle me from afar or aim to make a bold impression. Friends and acquaintances rush up to say hello and the photographer motions me for picture after picture.  But I am at work and this is no partying time for me. My evening gown, and my made-up face are my overalls. We have invested a lot of time and money putting together this exhibit. My budget tells me exactly how many paintings we must sell to make a profit or to break even. 

I move swiftly through the crowd towards the flamboyant couple with whom John was talking. I have never seen them before. They are now standing in front of the signature piece of the show “Urban Desire.”

“Stunning, isn’t it?” I said and introduced myself. The couple is visiting from Texas and staying at the plush Montage resort. The rooms at the Montage average $2000 a night. 

After only a short time, I learned the art business is money business. Art is a luxury purchase based on psychology as much as economics. Some people bought art for the love of it, and some for investment and vanity. But for whatever reason people bought art, I couldn’t sell a $50,000 dollar painting to someone who did not have $50,000 to part with. 

I chat with the couple about the painting, the artist, and its collector’s value. The husband is enthralled but the wife remains unconvinced. After all, it is a life-sized woman in a most provocative pose. We hung the painting in our front window facing the Pacific Coast Highway and it drew people--particularly men--in like flies. The painting proved to cause too much stir for Puritan Lagunaites who wanted to keep Laguna a sleepy town. They entered the gallery and demanded that we remove the painting from the storefront window. “We have young children,” they complained indignantly. “We don’t want them exposed to this obscenity.” I told them the painting was not about sexuality but freedom; and where we hang our merchandise in our store is our decision. I pointed out that the mannequins in the bikini shop up the street were no better covered than our Urban Desire lady. They were unswayed and threatened to raise an issue with City Hall and picket the gallery. I told them go ahead since my friends from City Hall loved the painting and picketing would score us free publicity. They stormed out of the gallery and never returned. I recounted the incident to engage the Texan couple and also to point out the difference between pornography and art, and the anxieties of a society that lives off selling sex but remains hypocritical about it. 

As I am getting the couple’s contact information to follow up, Dr. Mel budges over, gives me a big hug, and plants a kiss on my cheek. “You look fabulous, my dear,” he gushes in his thick New Yorker accent. The couple exchanged a look of understanding, excused themselves and quickly walked away. I bristled with annoyance at Dr. Mel for causing my big fish to slip away. 

I first met Dr. Mel at his beach house party a few months back. Dr. Mel is a New Yorker and a retired Jewish doctor who sold a medical insurance company he started. He lives alone in a giant beach house, with his boat, his Bentley, and his Ferrari. He has been pursuing me for a while now. I find his advances half annoying, half amusing and not at all flattering. Had I not been approached by rich old men in Pittsburgh, I would have been puzzled by the male psychology that makes a man pursue a woman half his age. But even with experience, and the awareness that this is Orange County, where the scoring system in mating was skewed by money and where the dynamics between rich old men and young gold diggers reached new heights, I still couldn’t forgive him for his presumptuousness. He fumbled a basic rule of courting: He had failed to read a woman accurately. I found it off-putting that he can’t tell the difference between me, an independent business woman and the Orange Country gold diggers who chose a mate on the size of his wallet. 

I have been evading his advances and dismissing them as harmless farce.  But John insists he be invited to the opening and the after party. In fact, Dr. Mel is sending his limo and driver to transport everybody from the gallery to Hush for the after party.  I know what John is thinking: He wants me to turn Dr. Mel’s attraction to me into sales: “The guy has tons of money, a huge house with lots of blank walls, and he will do anything for his beloved Lily.” John finishes his sentence with a lecherous wink, imitating the flirtatious incursions of Dr. Mel. 

While talking to Dr. Mel, I catch John’s eyes from across the room. John winks at me with a knowing smile. He is gloating over my irritation at Dr. Mel’s advances. John knows how intolerable it is for me to deal with the effrontery of libertines. I glare back at him to let him know that I am furious at him too for not coming to my rescue and, worse, taking amusement in my vexation.

******

The after party is at the racy, deafening loud and inhumanely packed club Hush. I sit at the bar in the midst of a three ring circus. Fighting the noise, I am doing my best to carry on a conversation with the man of the evening, Wang Niandong, who stands to my left. Dr. Mel has maneuvered himself inches to my right to track my conversation, looking for any opening. Out of nowhere, a flashy Asian guy plants himself next to Dr. Mel, and declares me the hottest Asian girl he has ever seen. 

“I never go out with Asian women. Most of them are too ‘Asian’.” he says, trying to flatter me. “But you are different, you have style.” He gives me his card – some marketing executive – of course, everybody is somebody in Orange County, and asks me to call him. 

I take his card, smile through his pretention and tell him I have a boyfriend. I tell him that I too am very “Asian”.  

Adding to the frisson of the moment, a blonde woman with a skimpy red sequined top, tipsy and unsteady, walks by and spills her Martini on me. She did not stop or apologize. She saunters on as if nothing has happened, which instantly enrages me. I leap up and tap the woman on the shoulder. “Hey, you spilled your drink on me.” 

The blonde woman turns around, her face in a stupor and her boobs spilling out of her scanty top. I look intently into her eyes and wait for her to apologize. Instead, she turns nasty and defensive. 

“Look at you and your fancy dress,” The woman mocks. “I can buy you ten of those dresses. All my dresses are $5000 and more.” 

“I do not give a fuck how many expensive dresses you have, you spilled your drink on me, you need to apologize.” I glare into the woman’s blue eyes with a controlled seethe. The woman tries to return the stare, her jaw quivering, and she is about to lose it. I brace myself for a fist in my face or the rest of her Martini pouring over my head. The crowd around us freezes. There is a sudden hush. All eyes turn on the blonde and me. 

The spotlight of public attention proved more than the blonde could bear.  She let out an audible “I am sorry” to puncture the drama.  All eyes watching us turn back to their business.  I am surprised when the blonde continues the conversation. “Where are you from?”

“Pittsburgh…China originally,” I say. “Where are you from?”

“Washington DC,” The blonde says, “No wonder, you are an east coast bitch like me. The west coast bitches do not have your guts. I like you, let me buy you a drink.” 

“What are you doing in Orange County?” I ask her.

“Gold digging,” the blonde says self mockingly as she points at a guy who stands a few feet away, obviously her gold mine, “Just like everybody else. Lots of money here.” The woman says with a self-mocking laugh. 

“Why are you here?” the woman asks. 

“It is a long story.” I say. 

*****
I did not tell the blonde my story because I did not think she would be interested or understand. I excuse myself to return to my group. My head is spinning from the wine I have been drinking and my feet are killing me from the strappy high heels. It has been a long day and I am spent. Everything around me starts to blur and fade out. I see through the dark haze of people’s faces, some engaged and lively, some bored and dazed. Their mouths open and shut but their voices are drowned in the sea of noise. Some people are laughing and cheering. At this time of night I assume it is from their buzz, not the wit of their conversation. A few couples make out brazenly, with a touch of greed and desperation, as if to seize the last moment of lust and heat. They had planned for sin as the nightcap and they want it dispatched before they awake to a new morning alone. 

The blonde’s words lingered in my ears and I asked myself: “Why are you here?”

## Chapter 26           Back in Business 

While I was in Xian, Xiaoqiang had been trying to reach me. The day I returned to Xuzhou, we had a long chat online. 

Since our first meeting, Xiaoqiang had looked up to me as a role model and solicited my advice on his daily struggles. He seemed to be working hard on his new job selling nutritional supplements to senior citizens. He even tried to sell to my father through me and promised me dinner afterwards. Xiaoqiang’s dinner offer was conditioned by the Chinese’s rule of guanxi: To get things from others, one must indebt them with gifts or the promise of future reward. Xiaoqiang did not understand I was happy to help him expecting nothing in return, even after he reneged on his promise to brief me further on the ernai brokering business. 

Like most Chinese, Xiaoqiang was keenly aware of status differences and ranks.  From the moment we met, I could tell he felt a mixture of admiration and envy towards me because, as he put it, I “live in a different world and high quality life” far above his. My “flat” American thinking, oblivious to rank, disarmed him but never fully eliminated his guardedness. Xiaoqiang’s withholding additional ernai brokering information from me, I assumed in his mind at least, gained him some leverage over me. 

However calculating Xiaoqiang was with me, he impressed me with his genuine selfless concern towards the female student from Xuzhou Normal University who had asked him to find her a patron. He did not find her a patron, but tried hard to find her a part time job in sales promotion. “You should write a book on how student workers are exploited,” he told me. 

Xiaoqiang told me it was hard for students to find part-time jobs. The jobs most available to them were handing out promotional leaflets in the streets. I had seen these people standing like light posts on the streets of Xuzhou, dressed casually, and on the streets of Beijing, dressed in black business suits and ties. They stood in extreme heat and cold for hours at a time, thrusting their flyers into the hands of passers-by who whisked by to avoid the nuisance, with looks of indifference or contempt. But even for such crummy jobs, students had to jump hoops to get them. They had to deposit 200-300 Yuan for the hand-outs and were seldom paid what they were promised ($5 instead of $10 a day). They were lucky to get their deposit back. 

“The government was so corrupt. The gap between rich and poor is getting bigger. Students are the cheap labor that anyone can exploit,” Xiaoqiang said bitterly. He had worked those jobs himself and knew all about it.

There were simply too many people, too few jobs, and too much competition. That was why Xiaoqiang felt if he wanted to make money, he had to be inventive. Brokering ernai was inventive but I had no idea how inventive until Xiaoqiang told me he decided to write a book. The idea came out of nowhere and I asked him what the book would be about. 

“The secret of keeping a woman’s youth and figure,” Xiaoqiang said confidently, proud of his ingenuity. 

I was as surprised at Xiaoqiang’s topic as his idea of writing a book. I asked him how he knew the secrets of keeping women’s youth and figure. Xiaoqiang said: I do not know, but you do. You are forty-three but look twenty-two. The whole time I was with you, I thought you were my age. What environment do you live in? How do you keep your youthful figure? How do you take care of yourself daily?

At first I thought he was joking or flattering me. I told him I did not have any secrets. I simply exercised and tried to live a healthy life. But he was serious and bombarded me with questions: What exercise? How do you plan your exercise routine? What time do you exercise? For how long? What do you eat? And drink? .... 

As I answered Xiaoqiang’s questions I thought his book idea was a lark. What I did for fitness was common knowledge in America and I did not see a need for a new book to be added to the thousands already written. But I also knew many Chinese my age were unhealthy because of overwork, stress, and lack of physical exercise. Health notwithstanding, youth and beauty were becoming increasingly important in China. Women of all ages were doing everything to look young and beautiful. Many young women kept books of glamor shots to land jobs and mates. Plastic surgery was rampant. Many Chinese women would go under the knife to become the look-a-like of the “it” movie actress of the time.

I understood how Xiaoqiang’s mind worked: Chinese think America has the best of everything, including the latest technology, gadgets, and the most advanced drugs and medicine. Since I live in America, I must have access to secret recipes for my youthful looks that Chinese do not have. Ironically, Americans attributed my youthful look to my Chinese traditions and genes. In truth, it was nothing but clean living with some discipline. But in Xiaoqiang’s mind, if he could get my secrets and teach them to Chinese women, he could make a fortune. 

*****
Xiaoqiang’s inventive thinking, enthusiasm, and optimism soon fizzled. He could not find his student friend a part-time job and his own job was not earning him enough to eat. 

Xiaoqiang’s new job paid little base salary and mainly commission. It was a door-to-door sales job that relied heavily on family, friends, and existing guanxi which, as a non-local, he did not have. I assumed his rural background brought additional challenges. Xiaoqiang told me when he took the job, his employer promised him a company dorm. Dorms and simple meals were promises commonly made to low-skilled employees in return for low wages. Xiaoqiang was counting on room and board but the company had not kept its promise. Desperate, Xiaoqiang was considering going back to brokering ernai and asked for my advice. 

I did not know what to tell him. I applauded him for leaving ernai brokering and starting a new life with an honest job. But I also understood how hard it was for him to start anew in a strange city with no money, family background, or guanxi. I told Xiaoqiang he should do what was best for him. But I cautioned him to be careful if he decided to go back to ernai brokering because my brother Shiguang said it was illegal. And if he felt he could not make it in Xuzhou, he probably should go home.

“But my father is not talking to me because he is still angry at me for dropping out of school. It will be hard for me to ask him for money even to buy the train tickets home,” Xiaoqiang said. 

I knew a parent would never turn his back on his child.  But I also knew Chinese sometimes had stubborn pride and would not ask for help because of mianzi. I did not know what else to say other than offer to buy him a train ticket home and dinner for him and the girl from Xuzhou Normal University if they had no money to eat. Xiaoqiang thanked me, and told me he would go to the train station the following day and let me know. 

*****
The following evening he messaged me and told me he was taking two students to meet with a client in the afternoon. “I never dreamed that I would be forced into it this time – going back to being a broker,” Xiaoqiang said, “Because I need money to eat.”  

I said nothing but thought to myself: I offered to buy you food and train tickets. If you go home, I am sure your father will feed you until you get back on your feet no matter how mad he is at you. Maybe he was too proud to accept my help. Or maybe he wanted more than just meals and train tickets. I somehow felt Xiaoqiang wanted something from me by crying poor in front of me. But it did not feel right to give money to an able-bodied young man. It seemed he had made a lot of money brokering ernai with Tongtong. 

I ask him what he did with the money he made from his past ernai dealing. He told me he had spent it all. 

Why hadn’t he saved something for rainy days? I thought to myself. Xiaoqiang wore cheap shoes and clothes from street peddlers but he carried the latest iPhone and iPhones in China are triple the price of what they cost in America. I was reminded that even though Xiaoqiang was from a poor rural family and had no steady job, he was still part of the post 90s generation that had lost the conservatism and frugality of China’s long traditions. He was part of the “spend every Yuan one earns each month and leaving nothing for saving” tribe. His lack of planning and savings forced him to improvise his life each day. Many of the chatroom women shared the same mentality. Besides sex and emotional entanglement, these young women talked fervently about shopping for shoes, clothes, cosmetics, weight loss products, home furnishings, cars, phones, and gadgets. They spent every Yuan they had and expected their parents or lovers to bail them out. 

I was surprised how quickly Xiaoqiang was able to find patrons and female students. He told me he was still using the qq number with the tagline: “Ernai and xiaosan broker, specializing in female students.” So even when he left the business, he still kept one foot in and received inquiries from men and women daily.  

I was curious about the women he brokered and peppered him with questions: What were the girls like when you introduce them to the man? Were they nervous? Their age? Rural or urban? And what were their requirements? Xiaoqiang told me the women were around twenty, some rural some urban; to most of the women, meeting the patron was a game to them. They had no requirements; he sets all the conditions. 

I asked to interview them but Xiaoqiang told me I would scare them off. I offered to shadow him when he took the girls to the patron to see how the deals were made. Xiaoqiang remained secretive about many things in ernai brokering since our last meeting. I thought by going with him, I could witness the transaction and acquire firsthand knowledge. Xiaoqiang counter-proposed: “You should let me introduce you to a patron. You will learn how things are handled and how the women feel and how the men think by doing it.”

I thought Xiaoqiang was joking. But he was not. He told me I would be popular because I looked “twenty-two, beautiful, with an exceptional aura.” I told him I can meet with the men and talk to them but I can’t go to bed with them. 
“How would you know what it feels like to be those women without being them? Plus the patron would feel played if you met with him but rejected him afterwards. It would not be good for business,” Xiaoqiang said. 

I thought Xiaoqiang’s offer outrageous. I told him I would not sleep with a patron to get information. As if to provoke me further, Xiaoqiang made me another offer no less preposterous. He tried to convince me to buy his ernai brokering business from him and listed the benefits: I could run it from America and get all the information for my book. 

*****

The following afternoon Xiaoqiang messaged me all disappointed. The deal fell through. But he was vague about why. He told me the “boss” had special tastes and did not get good vibes from the girls on first impression. The man was a forty-year-old official with lots of money and a very particular taste in women. I told Xiaoqiang to forget about it and that my offer still stood if he needed money to buy train tickets home. 

But later that evening Xiaoqiang told me the deal was done.  The patron had given it a second thought and agreed to keep one of the women, at a reduced fee. 

 “All settled, shame, shame. This is the last time I will do this. Now I will have money to buy train tickets home,” Xiaoqiang said. His self-targeted guilt could not conceal his self-congratulatory tone. 

But Xiaoqiang’s good mood did not last. He complained about being shortchanged. To make a quick deal, he only charged the client 2000 Yuan for the introduction. He used to charge 20,000 and split it with Tongtong. 

“People from Xuzhou are so cheap. He tried hard to reduce my fee. I should go back to Taiyuan. The coal bosses there are much more generous,” Xiaoqiang said. 

The following afternoon, Xiaoqiang was distraught. He told me he “could not take being the god damn broker anymore” and lamented “Maybe I can do this when I “do not have a heart and a lung” (meaning a person without feeling). It is for the people who have no conscience.” 

I asked him whom he felt guilty towards? The women?

“Yes. A person should walk the right path. Do you understand what I mean? Maybe I will never be “without heart and lungs.” I can’t bear the guilt on my conscience. I would rather kill than do this.” 

I had heard Xiaoqiang expressing his misgivings about ernai brokering, but this was the strongest he had ever voiced guilt about it. I told him not be too hard on himself. With so much inequality in China, people were forced to do what it took to survive. But my attempt to comfort him did not assuage his guilt. He began to express hatred, directed at others and himself: “I want to kill somebody or kill myself. I wish I had no feelings. I am too sensitive, indecisive and have no confidence.”

I assumed something bad must have happened but Xiaoqiang gave me no clues. He evaded answering my questions. Our conversation took off like two arrows shooting in opposite directions before he turned on me.

Lily: Is it because you made a deal and it made you feel guilty?

Xiao:  It is driving me out of my mind. 

Lily:  What drives you out of your mind? Being a broker?

Xiao: I wish I could be like Tongtong.

Lily: In which way?

Xiao: There is something I am not sure whether I should say.

Lily: Go ahead.

Xiao: I feel like every thing you say is to pry something out of me, to get information. 

Xiaoqiang’s remark stung. After knowing him for a while, I realized he was insecure and had a deep sense of inferiority, probably from his rural background, his shady job or the loss of his mother at a young age. I had been sensitive to his reluctance to share information on ernai brokering and handled his pride with kid gloves. I told him I never meant to pry and did not want him to tell me any thing he was uncomfortable telling me. He apologized for being paranoid and hypersensitive. He confessed: 

I think over every little thing and feel heavy in the chest. I can’t concentrate and I hardly had the strength to speak because I have no security and no confidence. I am full of self-pity and feel my life is good for nothing and I have no hope. If someone irritates me now, I might lose it and do things that are unpredictable.  

When I first met Xiaoqiang, he was so soft spoken I could hardly hear him. Now I saw a cornered animal who would strike at the slightest provocation. His condition concerned me. I had read in the Chinese news how the pressures of big city living caused people to live on the edge, resulting in growing violence even murder.  I asked Xiaoqiang what he would do. He told me if the boss continued to play him, he would risk going to jail to expose him. He was a famous official and had much to lose. 

It finally came out how the boss had “played” him. Xiaoqiang had presented the man two students to choose from. But the girl he picked caught a cold and could not engage him until she got better. So he made a deal with Xiaoqiang to “buy one get one free.” The woman who was not sick would sleep with him, but once the sick girl recovered, both women would take turns sleeping with him for the price of one. Needing money, Xiaoqiang reluctantly agreed. But the patron kept bargaining for a lower price on the grounds he was short-changed. Xiaoqiang needed the money desperately and the patron was hanging him on tenterhooks. 

Xiaoqiang asked me whether my brother had found anything out about Tongong. I told him I had checked with Shiguang and the police but no one heard of anyone in their files by that name. Out of the blue, Xiaoqiang broke out: “I do not care. It is best that he was arrested and sentenced to death! I wish him dead and go to hell.” 

Since I met Xiaoqiang, he had always talked about Tongtong respectfully and with fond memories. He told me the reason he came to Xuzhou was to find Tongtong because Tongtong always treated him well. But since coming to Xuzhou, he could only afford to eat one meal a day and was hungry all the time. He blamed his bad experience on Tongtong because he came to Xuzhou to find Tongtong. This explained why Xiaoqiang looked so thin and why he carefully collected the sugar and cream packets in MacDonald’s when we left. But at dinner, because I was not eating much, he ate little too and did not take the leftovers home when I asked him. I was always appalled by the wastefulness of Chinese banquets where the hosts deliberately ordered much more than the attendees could ever eat. No one dare take leftovers home on pain of losing face. The host and the attendees needed to prove they were rich enough to waste. In Xiaoqiang’s case, he would rather go hungry than to lose mianzi in front of me. I am Chinese, I should have known. 

*****
I told Xiaoqiang to relax and look at the big picture. Whatever was happening would soon be over. I told him he might be suffering from anxiety and depression. Xiaoqiang agreed with me and pressed me for answers on how to change his life. 

“Do you have any suggestions on what I should do to make money?” he asked. “Ernai brokering is not making me enough money even if I broker ernai full time. The most I can make is about one Million Yuan a year.” 

 “So one Million Yuan a year is not enough money to you? How much money do you want to make?” 

“Not really. Of course the more the better. Dream has no limit,” Xiaoqiang said. 

I could not believe my ears. This is a twenty-one-year-old rural man without a college education who had no money to eat. Now he was telling me one million Yuan ($166,666) a year was not enough money for him while the average annual salary of most Chinese was only 36,000 Yuan ($6000). 

Xiaoqiang disclosed what was feeding these improbable aspirations:
“I watched on TV that some of the antiques were sold for hundreds of millions and billions. A young man who was an excavator driver bought an antique for 10,000 Yuan and sold it for 100,000,000. Another person bought a chicken blood jade and sold it for 300,000,000 Yuan.” 

I found Xiaoqiang’s expectations out of line. He just made 2000 Yuan simply by introducing a student ernai to a patron and thought it too little money. 2000 Yuan was an average Chinese worker’s monthly salary. Xiaoqiang struck me as a paradox of low self-esteem and outlandish entitlement, which seemed a mentality all too rampant in many Chinese. The small percentage of Chinese who had ascended to great wealth through corruption had warped the perspective of many Chinese on wealth, effort, and reward. It filled people with outrageous dreams.

The few days in Xian going around banquets made me see how the men with means humiliated themselves and damaged their livers to get ahead. But at least they had earned the privilege to enter the guanxi network. People like Xiaoqiang and the female student he represented were outsiders to this network. They did not have the opportunity to humiliate themselves and damage their liver to get ahead even if they wanted to. All they had were unlimited rights to dream. The bigger the better. But a dream is just a dream. 

## Chapter 27           Ernai are People Too

I came across Zheng Baichun’s name in my ernai search. His Ernai’s Rights Advocate website not only caused controversy on the Chinese Internet but also brought him international fame -- he was interviewed by every major news agency in North America, Australia, and Europe. The Western media had picked up the Chinese ernai phenomenon for all its juiciness and shock value, and speculated about China’s return to concubinage. Giving voice to the “Chinese Lawyer Representing the Rights of the Second Wife” brought salaciousness to the hot topic of Chinese human rights issues. But to most Chinese, Zheng’s fame was suspect. He was fighting a one-man crusade for the rights of ernai against the majority of Chinese who condemned them. The public viciously attacked him for condoning immorality that undermined family values. It was rumored on the Internet that his wife divorced him because of it. I was thrilled when Zheng agreed to meet me in China. But pinning him down proved a major challenge. 

He traveled a lot and was extremely busy. Though I offered to travel to any Chinese city to meet him, he was never in one place for more than two days. Had he not apologized sincerely every time he postponed our meeting, I would have thought he was blowing me off.  But he was such an important link on ernai, I resolved to interview him even if he was evading me. It took three weeks and a string of broken appointments before we finally met in his hometown Liuan, where he was opening a restaurant.  

Zheng picked me up at the Liuan train station and arranged for me to stay in a small hotel adjacent to the building where he kept an office. A personable middle-aged man of medium height, sturdy build, and a full head of brushy black hair, he thought before he spoke, and answered my questions with decorum, clarity, and confidence. But his semi-formal carriage could not conceal his impish glee. During our conversation, he had to excuse himself several times to answer phone calls. “Sorry, too busy,” he apologized graciously afterwards, but seemed to thrive on his busyness. 

*****

Zheng Baichun was born in 1959 and grew up during the Cultural Revolution in the rural area of Liuan, a midsized city in Anhui province. During the Great Leap Forward, 5.48 Million people died of starvation in Anhui province, exceeded only by Sichuang province where10 million starved to death. Even today, the Anhui rural area remains less developed than other rural areas of China. Zheng Baichun’s grandparents worked hard and accumulated enough to buy a few acres of land and a cow, and hired a tenant to work for them. They had a little more than other villagers but did the back-breaking work in rice patties and lived as frugally as their neighbors. But when the Communists “liberated” China in 1949, they were classified as landlords for owning land and a cow, and hiring a tenant. The landlord status made them “people’s enemies” in China’s “class struggle” with no political rights. In the village, his parents were forced to do the most squalid labor, such as cleaning the public outhouse, without compensation, They were routinely humiliated and forced to “self-criticize and confess” publicly. Anyone could bully them with impunity. Baichun was not allowed to go to school in his village. He had to walk two hours each way to a school in a neighboring village where people did not know his family history.

Besides these injustices, what broke Baichun’s heart as a young boy was how his father abused his mother. Baichun loved his mother but could not stop his father from beating her. Even today, though legally married, his mother lived in a separate house from his father to avoid violence. This pain shaped much of Baichun’s adult life and inspired him to champion the underdogs of society, particularly women. 

Before talking about ernai, Baichun told me about his brewery and restaurant business. He was thrilled to find out about my international business background and eager to explore opportunities with me to sell his liquor to America. He had stopped representing ernais three years ago because he ran out of money. “Representing ernai brought me international fame but I was going broke,” he said, with regret but also pride. “But I firmly believe in the cause. After I make some money from the brewery business, I will reactivate the website.” 

As passionate as he was defending ernai, Baichun beamed talking about his business. He had acquired the brewery years ago from a bankrupted client but only recently started to invest money and time into it. The restaurant was designed to be a promotional platform for his liquor sales. The liquor was made in Maotai town in Guizhou province, the same town where Maotai, the most famous Chinese liquor was distilled. It was said the water in Maotai town was most suitable for brewing. 

Maotai’s sales had nosedived after President Xi blacklisted it as an exorbitant brand in his anti-corruption campaign. No Chinese official had dared drink it in public since. Baichun saw this as a great opportunity. His liquor tasted very much like Maotai but cost much less. To support President Xi’s anti-corruption campaign and Xi’s intention to appease the increasing conflict between party cadres and the people, Baichun cleverly named his liquor “Jin Min Jiu” (get close to the people liquor). 

He was so proud of his inventiveness that he asked me to find a way to gift President Obama a bottle of “Jin ming jiu” to attract media coverage. I smiled at Baichun’s cleverness to kill two birds with one stone.  First, in a marketplace fraught with fakery and inferior quality, Chinese consumers relied on authorities to gauge product quality. Second, drinking a liquor endorsed by the American president would instantly elevate people’s mianzi—not to mention the media sensation that would be generated by associating the liquor with Obama’s name! With the media tightly controlled by the government, the Chinese Internet was the only space where ordinary people could find a voice. With no prominent family or official rank, Baichun had to be resourceful to create his own splashes. He had tasted the power of fame from representing ernai and he wanted to repeat that media success with his business. 

*****

Ernai first caught Baichun’s attention in 2002 when a woman
named Xiao Zhang from Shenzhen came to him for representation. 

Xiao Zhang, a single woman in her early twenties, took up with a married businessman who showered her with gifts and attention. They shared deep feelings for each other and a loving relationship. When the businessman was diagnosed with terminal cancer and hospitalized, Xiao Zhang took meticulous care of him. The nurses at the hospital first held Xiao Zhang in contempt for being an ernai, but later warmed to her devotion to him. His estranged wife, who never showed up at the hospital, felt entitled to his estate. When she learned her husband left Xiao Zhang two hundred thousand Yuan in his will, she raised a fit with her dying husband. To make peace, Xiao Zhang surrendered her rights to the money. Two years after the man died, a now financially struggling Xiao Zhang came to regret her decision. She sought advice from Baichun on the will’s enforceability. Baichun told her the will was still enforceable, but because Xiao Zhang was an ernai and ernais were hated figures in the court of public opinion, she stood no chance of convincing a judge to rule in her favor. He advised Xiao Zhang to give up pursuing the case. 

Xiao Zhang’s case caused Baichun to self-reflect on what he was made of. Here was a woman with genuine love in her heart and the law on her side and, nonetheless, he had refused to stand up for her. He had let the tyranny of popular prejudice scare him off. As a child he had let his mother down because he couldn’t stand up to his father and the bullying villagers to protect her. Now he was repeating history and caving in to the tyranny of public opinion. 
In 2006 Baichun read about another ernai case that perturbed him. After her lover died of cancer, an ernai and her three year old were driven out of their apartment and had their living expenses cut off by the man’s wife. The legality of the wife’s actions was questionable because in a legally drafted will, the man had bequeathed the ernai and her child the apartment and some money. The point of contention was that the apartment was in the man’s name, and the woman was an ernai and her child illegitimate. These inconvenient details entitled the wife to seize legal possession of the apartment and the ernai’s inheritance after her husband’s death. 

The ernai went to court to seek justice. The judge not only ruled in favor of the wife and evicted the ernai and her child for violating “pubic order and good customs,” but also invited media to publicize the hearing. By publicly disgracing the ernai, the judge was sending a  message that ernais would not be tolerated in Chinese courtrooms. 

Baichun was angered by how public opinion against ernai was trumping the laws that should have protected them. The judges’ duty was to enforce the law but they brazenly looked past the law under the pressure of morality. 

Riled by these two cases, Baichun started to pay more attention to the rights of ernai. He became one of very few lawyers in China who deigned to represent ernais and the only one who did it pro bono when the woman could not pay him. Most ernais who came to him were abandoned, poor, and beset by physical or mental ailments. Baichun started the Ernai’s Rights Advocate website to raise public awareness and advocate ernai’s rights across China. Baichun recited his slogans to me with pride and righteousness: “Equality for everyone in front of the law and equality for man and women in front of morality. Just because somebody was judged morally wrong, she did not lose her legal rights as a citizen.” Baichun paused before dispensing his final slogan as if to collect himself with welling emotions: “Ernais are people too.” 

*****
During the three years Baichun represented ernais, he and his staff received eleven thousand telephone and internet inquiries from ernais across China and handled two hundred and ninety ernai cases. The women who came to Baichun for representation were between the ages of nineteen and thirty-five. All of them were abandoned by their patrons and five to eight percent of them had children with their men. By the time they came to Baichun, they were poor, mentally or physically ill, either from emotional abuse, STDs, or abortion. According to the statistics Baichun kept of his practice, ninety-five percent of those women had abortions, many multiple times, and some became sterile from having too many. Many lived in constant fear of being harassed and avenged by the first wives. 

Sixty percent of those women were from the rural area, thirty percent from small towns and ten percent from big cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Seventy-five percent of them graduated from middle school or high school, twenty percent graduated from college and five percent had Master’s and PhD degrees. The experience of ernai differed considerably based on their level of education. Uneducated ernais lived like caged birds without jobs and depended on their men entirely. Educated ernais enjoyed more freedom. Fifty-five percent of the women worked full time or part time but on average only earned fifteen hundred to three thousand Yuan from two hundred and fifty dollars to five hundred dollars monthly). All of the relationships between ernai and their patrons involved some financial support but the level of support varied. Some lived in apartments rented by their married lovers but some paid their own rent. Very few men bought their ernais apartments.  

This data gave me the bird’s-eye view I had been seeking after all the fish-eyes of chatrooms and one-on-one interviews. Baichun’s statistics, based on a cross-section of ernai in dire straits, contradicted the profile of the lazy gold digger ernai painted by Chinese media. They portrayed women from rural areas and small towns with little education and job prospects, women with a college education but low earning potential, and women living on modest allowances, with many paying some or all of their own living expenses. Even with patron support, Baichun’s clients were living an average or below average lifestyle. And they dropped into poverty the instant their patrons cut them off financially. 


*****
Baichun told me most ernais met their patrons at parties, work or other gatherings. To his knowledge, none of them went through brokers. In most cases, men pursued women. And surprisingly, sixty percent of the men disclosed their marital status upon meeting. Not so much out of honesty but fear that the ernai would want to marry them. Forty percent concealed their marital status until they had had sex or co-habited for a while with the women. But as soon as he sensed the ernai was growing attached he disclosed his marital status to lower her expectations. This timing proved the calculation and cruelty of those men. While the woman became attached and expected a commitment after losing her virginity, the man was strategizing his exit. Most men entered these relationships for short term novelty while the women hoped for long term stability--two trains on parallel tracks going in opposite directions. 

Baichun revealed a shocking fact to me to substantiate the short-term interests of the men. “There is no banquet that lasts forever,” he sighed. “The shelf life of these relationships on average is one year and eight months. Most relationships end around that time, especially when the women had a baby.” As Baichun explained:

The woman was overjoyed when she got pregnant, and started dreaming long term commitment with a baby as a string to attach the man. But the man thought just the opposite. As soon as the ernai got pregnant, the man started to look to other women for sex. He often took on another lover during the ernai’s pregnancy and delivery because it was inconvenient to have sex with a pregnant woman. But what sealed the breakup was when the ernai chose natural birth at delivery and stretched her vagina. After that, the man could not enjoy the tightness he relished. Now the ernai became like his first wife, what was the point of keeping her? With his money, he could always find a younger woman with a tighter vagina and he usually did. 

Baichun’s words indicated a tight vagina was what these men valued most in a woman. The woman and her body parts were treated as pleasure machines devoid of human feelings. Instead of being honored for entering motherhood, and all the pain and responsibilities it entailed, motherhood turned these women into last season’s goods. Xixi and Xiaoyou from the chatroom met their lovers during their wives’ pregnancy. They did not foresee that the same fate awaited them. 

“Were I an ernai consultant, I would have advised them to c section. One ernai I represented was smart. In order not to stretch her vagina, she had a c section and then had plastic surgery to smooth over the scars.” 

Now I recalled Xiaoning from “Wait for the moon” talking about having a c section when she delivered her baby. She said she would go under the knife for her marriage. Obviously Baichun’s finding was not a secret among Chinese women. But even this cleverness did not prevent the woman from being dumped, as in Baichun’s client’s case, who had a c section to keep her tightness uncompromised.

“Keeping her vagina tight and prolonging the time she was kept were not the real solutions,” I said, exasperated.

“Yes. And I dared not say a word about having c section to keep their vagina tight. It would have encouraged and condoned the men who were objectifying women. But I knew that was the reason why most of those men terminated the relationship. I had gotten to know many of them from handling the cases of the women they dumped. It was clear the main objective of these men was physical gratification, even though some of them did develop feelings for the women.”
But not enough feelings, apparently, for him to linger around. According to Baichun, the longevity of a second (or third…) wife was much shorter than the longevity of the first. When a man lost interest in his first wife sexually, it was still important to stay married to keep up with his family responsibilities and social respectability. Most Chinese would judge divorced men as irresponsible and uncaring. Government officials risk censure and even expulsion from the party if their personal life got out of hand. This was why Chinese men on the move chose to keep an ernai without divorcing their first wife. The Chinese called this “Keep the red flag at home upright and let the colored flags flow outside.” But without any obligation towards ernai, when the man lost sexual interest in her, he would not think twice about abandoning her.  

And surprisingly, as much as a chatroom woman wanted the man to herself, she also feared a man who would leave his family. She judged men who left their families as irresponsible and callous. She would say: “I would be afraid to get involved with a man who would leave his wife and family.” It reflected how deeply family values inhabited the Chinese psyche. The women in the chatrooms had few moral qualms about helping a man cheat on his wife. But they feared a man who would break up a family and disturb the social fabric. Ironically, by holding the man’s moral quality to a conventional standard, these women put themselves in a catch 22.

***

I asked Baichun why men chose to “keep” ernai instead of simply having an extramarital affair without financial arrangements. Baichun explained that the “keeping” arrangement created indebtedness and gave the man control over the woman’s movements. Providing the woman an apartment served as a second home to keep his woman “inside.” But the second home was only a “play house.” Although the men called the ernais “laopo” (wife), other than her monthly allowance, the men seldom involved the ernai in his financial matters such as investment and retirement. With the man in control, I suspected abuse and violence and asked Baichun to verify. Baichun told me that as far as he knew, physical abuse was uncommon but there was emotional abuse, especially during the woman’s pregnancy and delivery when she needed his support most. One of his clients was sexually abused by her patron. He brought home prostitutes and forced her to watch him have sex with them or to partake in a threesome. He beat her when she refused. I asked Baichun what he thought of gender inequality in China. Baichun replied emphatically that there was NO equality between men and women: 

It is an absolute double standard when it comes to morals between men and women. The value system people levied on men and women are polar opposites. Men can have multiple women, keep ernai, sannai, but women must stay with one man from start to finish; when men keep ernai and have extra-marital affairs, they felt no shame but pride; they saw it a sign of his capability. But when a woman does the same thing, she feels ashamed and can’t face her family and relatives. Men are admired and envied for keeping ernai and mistresses, women are called loose, a slut if she is involved with married men; she is judged and rejected. 

For thousands of years, men put countless invisible shackles on women. It is sad that most women accepted them readily and are used to them. Some even think it the natural order, and never complain.

Men cause tragedies for women one after another. Except for brief pleasures men bring women occasionally, they give women pain, STD, discrimination… not only the marginal women such as ernai, xiaosan, mistresses, it also include wives, girlfriends, fiancés. It seems women are meant to suffer, men are meant to enjoy, especially from pleasures provided by women. 

****
I had read much about Baichun’s views in my research and experienced it firsthand with the chatroom women and my other informants. But Baichun’s emotional delivery resonated with power and credibility because it was backed by his extensive work with a large pool of ernais across China. I probed him with one question that haunted me from the beginning of my research: Do women become ernai for love or for money? Even within the common frame that says “most ernais were poor rural women who looked to men for rescue” I still witnessed plenty of emotional entanglement among the chatroom women. Some of those women seemed to genuinely love their men and money was not all they were seeking. 

Baichun estimated that about forty percent of the women entered the relationship for money, and another forty percent developed feelings after being with the man for a while or having his baby. The remaining twenty percent stayed on the fence between the two positions. The deep feelings that a woman developed for the man caused ernai to suffer financial as well as emotional devastation at abandonment. Because of their lingering feelings for the men, Baichun often had to walk a tight rope between holding these men accountable to their financial obligations and staying soft-handed. In some instances the ernai he represented turned against him because she deemed Baichun too heavy-handed with a man she still loved. “It could get very complicated,” Baichun remarked. 

To gauge what role attractiveness played in being an ernai, I asked Baichun whether the women he represented as a group were attractive. He told me thirty percent were beautiful, forty percent 

“so-so” and the rest unattractive. Although these were only Baichun’s subjective assessments, they coincided with the impressions I had formed about the chatroom women. Beautiful “Extra” and “Haohao” used their attractiveness to leverage their relationships; those who were above average, like Peipei, clung to the best man they could find for love even if he could offer her neither money nor marriage; and those who were average like BP with poor marital prospects, settled for being xiaosan and expected little from the relationship. 

“Why don’t the beautiful ones find single men their age?” I asked.

“No suitable men. Some had boyfriends who were too poor. Some would rather “cry inside a BMW than laugh on the back of a bike.”

Abandoned Ernais, especially those with small children, faced a stark reality. Now older (nearing thirty), they had trouble finding another man to keep them. Men wanted younger women in their early twenties. They had little prospect of finding a suitable man to marry. The chatroom women on more than one occasion concurred that Chinese men did not like to marry women with children and were unforgiving of a woman’s previous marriages and sexual histories. Chinese men are known to be possessive of a women’s sexual body. No matter what age or stage of life he meets her, he wants to own her body exclusively and retroactively to her first sexual experience. Her child reminds him of the woman’s intimacy with another man and the woman’s previous sexual experience threatens his manhood. A friend of Zhang Sui’s killed the man who took his wife’s virginity long before they were married and was sentenced to death. 
Failing to find new men to keep her or to marry, many ernai fell into poverty, became physically and emotionally ill, with nowhere to turn. They were despised by society for violating moral codes and sabotaging marriage.
“But Ernai are people too,” Zheng said. “They have rights to property, privacy, and dignity. And a legal society must protect them.”

 *****

Baichun’s claim that “ernai are people too” deserving rights and legal protection made him a constant target for attack on the Chinese Internet. First wives, their children, and self-appointed moralists lacerated him with slurs and vituperations, and heaped abuse on his parents, his teenage son, even his ancestors. A fourteen year old boy left hateful curses on Baichun’s website for siding with the ernai. His father had taken an ernai and it had broken up his family. As a result, he did not go to school and squandered most of his childhood as a child delinquent. He held Baichun and scoundrels who condoned ernai responsible for ruining his life.

“I will never forget about all this hellish entanglement until the day I die,” Baichun said, shaking his head in sadness and disbelief. “When morality, desire, feelings, law, and conscience get entangled, everybody involved lived in torturous hell --everybody, including Ernai, the first wives, the men, their children, and their elderly parents.” 

Baichun’s sympathy for ernais and his willingness to represent them caught the attention of the Chinese media. Seventy-five percent of Chinese provincial TV stations interviewed Baichun and newspapers like “Zhejing Daily,” “Chinese Women’s Paper”, “Morning Paper”, “Xinmin Evening Paper” gave the interview full page coverage. The juicy nature of ernai stories and anything related to the ernai industry caught people’s eyeballs, and media and advertisers capitalized on it. I asked Baichun how the media treated him and his message. 
“Some tried to preach that keeping ernai was immoral and guaranteed bad endings. Some used it to openly oppose and discredit my position. Some did it purely for commercial reasons to gain viewership and sell more papers. Almost no one supported me openly,” Baichun said.

This led me back full circle to where I started my research, and confirmed my assumption that the Chinese Internet and media were selling sensation and morality more than uncovering the truth about ernai and xiaosan. 

Western media caught up quickly. BBC, NPR, Times, and other French, Austrian, and Swiss newspapers interviewed him, some multiple times. In comparison to Chinese media, western media was more curious and supportive of his cause. 
“All my family, relatives and friends said to me: ‘Stop doing this, what for? To get all those attacks and insults? It is not worth it.’” 

And for suspicious reasons, Baichun could not open his site even after changing servers and hosting companies several times. In China, all websites are registered with the government. I asked him whether he thought the government had tried to hack his website. He suspected so but could not prove it. He surmised that the government unit authorized to hack digital sites judged it to “promote bad morals and cause a bad influence among the public” and sought to block it.  

“I could not open the site in China but people told me they could open it in Hong Kong and America. But I eventually gave the site up. It was too much trouble to maintain it. It became such a headache,” Zhang said rubbing his forehead. “They won.” 

*****

But the dismantling of his website and his ernai law practice did not quash his desire to help ernai. To take the pressure off, he told his family and friends he had washed his hands of the cause. But he secretly kept in contact with many ernais and in some cases offered them part time jobs to make extra money to support their children.

“The government provided murderers and rapists free legal counsel when they needed it--why not ernai? Even prostitutes who contracted AIDS received sympathy and support--why not ernai? For some reason, everybody hates ernai fervently,” Zheng said sadly. 

“I wanted to say to people: Do not be so judgmental, narrow minded, and callous; have some compassion. Let our society be tolerant of different opinions. Even when people make a mistake, give them a second chance and lend a helping hand. Who gives the first wife rights to rip the ernai’s clothes off and beat her up anytime she pleases? Let’s not be so indifferent,” Baichun said with heartfelt conviction.

The Chinese press and Internet blamed ernai for the destruction of families, decadence and official corruption. Yet none of these stories captured a scintilla of the women I had come to know—their hopes, fears and struggles. By becoming acquainted with the women in the chatrooms, by catching up on the life of my desk mate Xuesong, and by hearing the stories of Baichun’s clients, it was becoming clear that many ernais were exploited and cheated. They were in a sense the most sympathetic victims because they were the victims who could earn no sympathy. 

*****
All the national and international fame earned Baichun few friends but big cash flow problems. He was burning through money maintaining the website and paying his staff with little money coming in. Most ernai he represented were in such dire financial straits that it would have been unconscionable for him to expect payment. Still, Baichun persisted, representing ernai full time for three years with six employees until he finally ran out of money

I could tell how much those women touched him and how much he cared about them. I commented on the sacrifices he had made to help those women and that they must be grateful to him. My passing comment ignited a new topic that got Baichun as animated as I had seen him. “Do not even mention that. I wasted so much time and money being played by ernais,” Baichun said. His remark surprised me. I asked him how these women would play him. 

He explained: Some women begged him to represent them, but after he spent time investigating the case, sometimes flying to her city, she would tell him to stop the process without paying him for the time he had already spent. One woman kept Baichun waiting for a week in her city to go to court for her before notifying him that she had withdrawn her suit against her man a week before. 

“I was outraged. I yelled at her. Why didn’t she let me know earlier and make me waste a whole week?” Baichun raised his voice recalling it. “Because she was afraid I would get upset with her and she was also afraid I would make her pay for my time.” 

“It sounds like some of them were not so considerate and responsible,” I observed. 

“No they are not. As a group--not everybody--the ernais I knew shared some common traits: selfish, irresponsible, suspicious, petty and stingy. They were overall insecure, some of them were confident only in their beauty. Some were mean.”   

“The pitiable are often pitiful,” Zheng concluded. 

One thing I learned from my research was that there was no stereotypes of ernai and xiaosan I could neatly put in a box. They were a complex group of women that can’t be easily labeled good or bad, rich or poor, strong or weak. Their backgrounds and motivations were widely varied. However I did observe some common personality traits of insecurity, low self-esteem, and dependency. But what was chicken and what egg? Was being insecure, irresponsible, and mistrustful predispositions for becoming ernai? Or was being ernai likely to induce these negative traits? Perhaps these traits were both predispositions and outcomes, with one strengthening the other. One thing seemed clear: This was a group of women who found themselves in an insecure position socially, economically, and psychologically and believed no one would look out for them but themselves. They were victims but also entitled by their ability to dish out pleasure and comfort to men who were willing to share their resources with them. 

## Chapter 28            A Country Divided 

My plan was to stay overnight and return to Xuzhou the following day. But Baichun invited me to stay an extra day to visit his family home in rural Liuan. Baichun’s rise from a poor rural boy to a prominent lawyer and an aspiring entrepreneur intrigued me. I was eager to see rural China. The first ernais in the early 1990s were female rural migrant workers in Guangdong province. Ninety percent of the ernais Baichun represented hailed from small town and rural China, and so had many of the chatroom women I had been interacting with. I was eager to see with my own eyes the rural life that so many young rural women sought to escape.

***** 
On our ride around the village I was surprised by the newly paved roads lined with two story houses of cement and brick. It was nothing like the Chinese villages I remembered. Eight years back when I visited my mother’s home village, I saw only dirt roads and mud houses with straw roofs.

During the two days I spent with Baichun, he repeatedly expressed his regret he could not support his parents better financially. His parents had suffered so much, now they were elderly, and Baichun wanted to provide them a life of comfort. But despite his modesty, I marveled at the two-story house Baichun had built for his parents. Even with rudimentary cement floors, white-washed walls and sparse furnishings, the living room was spacious with high ceilings. The only furniture in the room was a square table with four chairs and a long narrow table against the wall. In the center of the back wall hung an over-sized poster of the god of longevity in a red garment, long white beard, a cane, surrounded by gaily-faced small children. On the narrow table in front of the poster stood a gilded statue of the god of wealth offering outsized gold nuggets. On a sidewall, “prize certificates” that Baichun’s nephew had won as a star student were proudly pasted.

Baichun’s mother was a tall handsome woman in her early 70’s with tidily combed grey hair and neatly dressed. I could tell her face was once beautiful. She carried herself with dignity but her eyes revealed an unconcealable sadness. Before letting me take a photo of her, she went into her room to put on a more formal jacket. Her eyes looked into the camera aggrieved as if asking: Why world? Why? I reckoned her sadness came from a hard life being a landlord’s daughter and abused wife. When I asked her about her early life as a young woman and mother, she teared up telling me the number of times she thought of dying, including when she was pregnant with Baichun. Life was one insufferable hardship after another with no hope. She held a bottle of pesticide in her hand many times but never drank it because of her children. 

Unfortunately, her experience was not uncommon among rural Chinese women, even today. Suicide rates in China are about three times the global average, and most suicides are young rural women. “Between 1995 and 1999, Chinese women committed suicide at a twenty-five percent higher rate than Chinese men and rural suicides were three times the rate of urban areas.” A recent study on rural suicide in China argues that mental illness is not so much a factor. The greater factor is impulsive acts that women take after quarrels with family members that undercut their position in the family hierarchy. A woman gets into a fight, loses face, and ingests a bottle of organophosphate pesticide to save face. Swallowing pesticide is the preferred method because it is painless. Suicide attempts predominate in the summer when the farm work is “exhausting and tensions run high.” Some studies suggest that women kill themselves because of domestic violence and abuse. Others suggest that suicide may spike after women see their dreams crushed in the city and return home empty-handed.  

Baichun’s father did not share his mother’s dignified bearing. He was short, probably shrunk by age, and dressed in shabby and dusty clothes. Deep wrinkles marked his withered brown face and missing teeth had sunken his cheeks. But sparks of shrewdness in his eyes differentiated him from most other peasants I had seen. 

I felt displaced sitting in the middle of the room and drinking tea. This was nothing like the Chinese rural area I had imagined. Had China changed so much that its rural area had disappeared? 

My question got answered when I opened the back door to a walled backyard and saw a run-down bamboo shed and chickens and ducks in a fence. Yes, this was more like it! I asked for Baichun’s permission to take some photos. He discussed my request with his mother in the Liuan dialect. I could tell neither the mother nor Baichun understood why I, an American woman from the “rich” world, would be interested in photographing a primitive shed. But they good naturedly allowed me space to wander by myself. My curiosity did not stop with the shed and the animals. I opened the back gate in the walled courtyard and my eyes widened. Here it was--the real Chinese rural area from my childhood memories!

I looked out on fields of green vegetables, blooming yellow mustard, and a small pond surrounded by weeping willows on which a duck family leisurely skimmed. A little farther back were some mud houses with chickens feeding in the front. I wandered off the narrow muddy path and took in the village in one gaze. The beautiful panorama of a rural Chinese village left me in reverie. Baichun came out to find me, surprised how far I had wandered. I asked him whether those mud houses were still occupied; he said yes, by his relatives. I asked to visit them and he reluctantly consented. It turned out one of the mud houses was his childhood family home. While Baichun’s mother lived in a room in the new house with Baichun’s younger brother and his wife, Baichun’s father lived in the mud house. The mud walls and gate of the backyard had separated the two worlds.

I was thrilled to have found this. It proved that I had not been hallucinating about a Chinese rural area that never existed. It still exists undercover. The mud house I visited in mother’s home village had windows, high ceilings and rooms separated by cloth curtains. Baichun’s family home was a one-room building, about the size of an average American family room. It had no window so the only light came from the door during the day and one bare light bulb hanging down from the ceiling at night. When Baichun opened the backdoor to a small backyard crammed with more chicken behind a fence, I was overcome by a strong smell of chicken manure. The bed was a wooden board sitting on stacks of bricks in the left corner of the room. A white mosquito net that had blackened with age draped over it. Against the right wall was a chest with broken handles and warped drawers. In the corner next to the chest, were stacks of farming tools, cooking utensils, storage buckets, wooden benches and bamboo sieves. The wooden front doors were unpainted, worn, ill-fitting and agape on the bottom, barely able to keep out the cold draft in the winter. The house had no toilet. I assumed the mud wall by the pond served as an outhouse. Pasted on the outside of the doors from the Spring Festival was a paired set of faded-red streamers with Chinese calligraphy whose script read “special dragon land”,  “wait for fortune”, and “happiness.” Baichun’s father proudly told me he did the calligraphy himself with brush and ink. 

I pulled out a small wooden stool and sat down to talk to Baichun’s father. With his Liuan rural accent, I could understand about seventy percent what he spoke. He told me excitedly he had some treasure to show me and went to retrieve them from under his pillow. He came back with two books and a compass. One book was on feishui called “Complete Collection on Ying Yang house,” the other was a fortune telling book based on Yijing. He told me it took him three years to decode the fortune telling book sitting under the mosquito net reading by flashlight at night. “But I got it now. It is an amazing book!” he exclaimed excitedly and smiled broadly showing his unkempt black teeth. 
Baichun rolled his eyes at his father’s showing-off and my keen inquisitiveness. His initial embarrassment turned to bemusement. He never thought I would be interested in seeing the mud house and talking to his father but I was immensely curious. His father, enthused by my interest, took me around the fields and showed me the broad bean and linin plants he had planted. 

Later that evening Baichun thanked me for visiting his family home and talking to his parents. “Nobody talks to them like you. I have not seen mother cry in front of a stranger as when she talked to you. And my father…. he was so happy to have found a loyal listener finally. No one in my family pays any attention to what he says,” Baichun said. 

“But father also warned me not to reveal too much to you because you are an American,” Vividly, Baichun mimicked his father, “‘She isn’t going back to America and tell people how poor and backward China is, is she? She is not going to talk badly of the Communist party, is she?’” 

I assured Baichun that was not my intention. Seeing the mud house and the vegetable fields fed my childhood nostalgia. I have been searching for the China of my youth and sometimes felt like an Alzheimer’s patient because nothing I saw matched my memories. But seeing the mud house and how Baichun’s father lived reinforced for me the gap between the Chinese rural and urban experience and why the rural youth so eagerly rushed to the city. 

*****
The new dwellings overwhelmed the few mud houses tucked away in sparse corners. Baichun told me the new houses could not have been built without the money sent home by the young people who left to work in the city. Income from farming was barely enough to eat and escaping poverty meant escaping the village. The majority who remained in the village were elderly and young children. Children unattended or raised by their elderly grandparents had become a social problem in rural China. In 2006, Zhang Huaguai from the Southwest Politics and Law Institute conducted a survey on young girls in a village outside Chongqing in southwest China whose parents had left them to work in cities. The survey found that of one hundred and twenty-two females from the ages of ten to fourteen, only one girl had a parent raising her. The parents of the remaining girls were all doing migrant work in larger towns and cities. Over ninety-nine percent of parents’ income came from working as migrant laborers. Less than one percent came from local farming. Although the girls did not like their parents being away from home, most of them understood their parents had no choice.

According to a 2010 survey of the China Women’s Federation, nearly fifty eight million children in rural China are being raised by one or neither of their parents. Eighty percent of them are raised by grandparents, leaving the remaining twenty percent a special cause for concern. More than four million are raising themselves, with no continuous adult supervision.  They are called the “left behind” children and the problems that will dog these children through each phase of their life --reclusiveness, insecurity, delinquency -- are only beginning to create concern. The Chinese documentaries “The last train home” and “Children Left Behind” depicted their stark reality. 

The world knew China as the economic miracle of the twenty-first century. But few knew the number one contributors to this fastest growing economy were Chinese rural migrant workers. An estimated twenty to two hundred million surplus laborers reside in rural China. Pawns of the laws of supply and demand, these workers were forced to sell their labor cheaply. To escape poverty, they left their young children and elderly parents behind to perform mind-numbing labor in exchange for inadequate pay and inhumane living conditions. In “Equal China – the key to unlock the new miracle in China for the next ten years,”  economist Wang Fuzhong pointed out: 

Migrant workers are probably the most optimistic group of people in the world. They dwell in the most primitive working hut, eat the most nutritionless meals, endure the most taxing labor all year round, with little rest, no entertainment and no emotional support, and dared not to spend any money because they make so little. The prosperity of the city does not belong to them. Delay in getting paid is common. They stand in queues for days just to buy train tickets to go home for the Spring Festival. Their children suffer with them, being turned down by day cares and schools because they do not have city Hukou. But despite all this, they persist living in the cities, hoping for a bright future. 

Ironically, as Wang Fuzhong also noted, China has a long tradition, from the neo-democratic revolution of the early twentieth century to the economic reforms of the late 1970s of jumpstarting development in the rural areas to set an example for the city. During the civil war and the Chinese Communist revolution, Mao relied on the rural areas for his “rural surround city” strategy, which was to turn the peasants “red” in the rural areas before winning over the workers in the city. Deng adopted the same strategy in his post Mao reform. He started economic reform with rural peasants before taking reform to the cities. As Fuzhong noted, those in the rural areas, destitute and desperate, tended to be more open for reform in comparison with their urban counterparts who at the time enjoyed a higher standard of living and security from the Iron Rice Bowl. 

With their earning capacity decimated and driven to extreme poverty by the commune system of the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution, peasants in the rural areas eagerly embraced Deng Xiaoping’s policy that made them responsible for profit and loss on a small patch of land. For the first time since 1949, human motivation was recharged, hard work incentivized and the desire to produce unleashed. Agricultural productivity began to soar. The reform era also saw the expansion of Town and Village enterprises (TVEs), public and private businesses owned and located in rural towns and villages. Between the late 1970s and the mid-1990s, when TVEs peaked, the number of rural workers employed by TVEs expanded from twenty-eight million to one hundred and thirty-five million. The value of all goods that TVEs produced increased from forty nine billion to almost two trillion Yuan. 

By the early 1980’s rural laborers were becoming the envy of urban workers clinging to low fixed incomes and an Iron Rice Bowl that was rapidly fracturing. But starting in the mid-1990s, the TVE sector went through dramatic upheaval. The primitive facilities, uneducated management, and untrained workforce of the TVEs could not compete with the emerging manufacturers supported by Taiwanese and Hong Kong businessmen with modern facilities, advanced technologies, and economies of scale. Most TVEs simply went out of business while the state-owned enterprises underwent privatization. The decline of TVEs sent rafts of rural workers to the cities to look for work as migrant workers, and this exodus helped fuel the urban economic boom. This exodus also carried with it the "floating population" or "black (e.g. black market) people" as well as rural migrants entering urban areas in search of work. 

Low wages and lack of benefits were only the start of the challenges rural workers faced. They were discriminated against for their birth, looks, taste, upbringing, poor hygiene, and their alleged primitiveness. As a group, rural migrant workers contributed vitally to China’s growing prosperity but benefited least from it. Although part of the prejudice directed at the rural workers may have had some foundation, much of it was self-interested. Neither the government nor the urbanities were invested in rural development or educating rural people. To keep the rural worker primitive was to keep them uncompetitive for rising higher in the Chinese economy, which in turn kept them on the bottom rung of the widening rich and poor gap.

With economic devastation, environmental and psychological devastation followed close behind. This is happening in many rural regions that have lost their youth and future to the cities. Towns and villages desperate for survival are ripe for scamming by get-rich-quick speculators and exploiters. My artist friend Haoli told me how much it pained her to witness the disastrous aftermath of a gold rush in her home village in the Yimeng Mountains. Her village was once rich in gold. Unscrupulous businessmen from Yunnan and Beijing used the villagers to mine for them, took the lion’s share of the profit, and paid the villagers crumbs. The mountains were hollowed, the ground water contaminated, and the environment irreversibly decimated. Many villagers died from drinking contaminated water from the mines. The Beijing businessmen did not care. Their families would never live there. 

“Those people are so primitive. They did not know they were hurting themselves,” Haoli said. But Haoli also understood why the villagers acted the way they did. They were uneducated and had lived destitute for generations. A paltry sum of money could easily dazzle them. They simply couldn’t comprehend what their actions meant for their children and grandchildren. All they saw was a king’s ransom placed before their eyes, more than they had ever seen in their lives. As it was depicted in a Chinese saying: “people will kill for money and birds for food.”

*****
Besides a ruined environment, poverty, desperation and greed blur the lines between right and wrong, and fray civility and human feelings. Trust disappears when too many people compete for too few resources and each believes that one can win only at the expense of another. This zero-sum mentality turns the mind primal and fearless. Knives were commonly flashed between neighbors, relatives, even brothers.  The families with the most boys became the biggest bullies of the village. But when the outside businessmen came with their money and power, the bullies with the knives, like everyone else, caved in. 

Haoli told me it was pretty much the same for all rural areas in China, realities that the rural scooter and taxi drivers in Beijing had described for me. They all told me how greed had crazed people’s minds and “blackened” their conscience. Some anthropologists of rural China have documented the economic and moral hollowing out of many small towns and villages. In a study of Zhaojiahe, a north-central village in Shaanxi Province, Berkeley anthropologist Xin Liu found many of the same disturbing declines. The residents had lost their sense of dignity and any semblance of a moral order had been replaced by money. Many facets of life once judged communal property were zealously hoarded within families. The fear of being “ripped off” by a fellow villager was epidemic.  Villagers saw wealth as deriving from connections and corruption rather than honest work or luck. Intense confrontations, including physical violence, permeated every sector of life, including weddings, where onlookers brawled and bridesmaids were roughed up even for the pieces of candy served. Families considered their only social security to be sons. 

The world of the rural community Liu described was masculine and agnatic, making the lineage of the father and brothers the decision-maker on every major decision governing the lives of wives and daughters.  I started to see how a rural woman would want to escape to the city, not just from the hard labor but from the sexism. But with the harsh working conditions and low pay, the vast influx of female rural migrant workers was providing China’s major cities with the largest supply of sex workers the world had ever seen.

You can take the child out of the country but can you take the country out of the child?  In China, the answer is a resounding no. The Chinese government creates mountains of red tape that make it impossible for migrants to forget their origin. Even young men and women who come to the city for an education and breeze into the urban lifestyle are judged more feudalistic and primitive. Some of this discrimination is perceived and some of it is real. But whether real or perceived, the urban/rural distinction is the fundamental divide in China. 

All city women I interviewed from the chatrooms refused to entertain the thought of marrying a rural man. The Chinese interns who helped us research this book told me they would never consider rural men as marriage prospect. Rural women faced similar discrimination from city men. This was an important reason why rural women, seeking footing in the city, would become ernai. 
In response, rural people practice reverse prejudice (probably out of defensiveness) against city people. When I interviewed the mother of my Chinese intern Emmie, she told me she would never consider marrying a city man. Both she and her husband were from rural areas, attended college, and landed white collar jobs in the city. Except for her slight rural accent, her clothes and bearing passed well for an urban woman. I wanted to know why an urban man would pass over a rural woman who legitimately came across as urban. She told me it didn’t matter how one looked, or how well-educated or well-employed she was. Urbanites, with rare exceptions, saw a rural person as obligated to a poor family back home who would require their ongoing financial support. And even when urbanites could get past the financial dependence issues, they couldn’t get past the mianzi issues of “marrying down.” “Who wants to be looked down upon in a marriage? Not me,” Emmie’s mother said defiantly. “I prefer sticking to my roots.” 

But I learned that “sticking to her roots” had caused Emmie’s mother frustration and heart rending at times. Her husband, from the same rural area she grew up in, although educated, was feudalistic. He routinely needled his wife for failing to bear him a son, as if she, not he, controlled the male chromosome. But what pained her more was how he related to Emmie. Although Emmie was a straight A student attending a prestigious American University (Carnegie Mellon), he often remarked ruefully: “Only if she was a boy,” sometimes in front of Emmie. His words would send Emmie to her room in tears and send the mother into a fury. But she could do nothing about his “I have failed as a man without a son” thinking that had been pounded into his head growing up. When Emmie’s grandfather died, he forbade Emmie from visiting his grave because she was not a boy. 

Emmie’s mother was educated and demanded equality, but the women working at the massage parlor that I frequented felt the same way. These women toiled long hours, were paid little, and did work most city women refused to do because the massage industry was linked to underground prostitution in China. But in marriage or in friendship they refused to be pitied. 

A twenty-four year old masseuse barely looked rural with light skin and dyed blond hair. She had slim long legs and a pretty face. She told me after being in Xuzhou for three years, she had no local friends. The only people she knew were her fellow masseuse from the country. She told me she was soon to marry a boy from her hometown arranged by her family. I asked her whether she liked the boy--she said so-so. Not like and not dislike. “Why didn’t you find a city boy to marry? You are pretty, I am sure there must be city boys after you.” 
“No I will never marry a city boy,” she said. “Most city men do not marry women with a rural Hukou. Only a city man with problems might marry one. I am not interested,” she said decisively. She told me a masseuse who worked there was shattered when her city boyfriend of two years broke off the engagement. His mother would not allow him to marry a rural woman.

Another masseuse in her early forties told me she had lived in Xuzhou for ten years and had yet to make one friend from the city. 

“I have nothing to say to them,” she said. “They thought they were somebody special, but there is nothing special about them. They thought they had more money or a bigger apartment; the house that my family built in my hometown is bigger and nicer. I ignore them.” 

I asked her why she came to the city. She told me she was here to make money. She told me she made about four thousand Yuan a month but masseuses who were willing to “accompany in a bath” and perform “penis treatment” made more. “Penis treatment” intrigued me and I asked her to elaborate. She explained with a sneer on her face: “You wear a surgical mask, gloves, and massage the penis for seventy minutes for two hundred and fifty Yuan.” I told her it sounded like a glorified hand job. She agreed and said indignantly: “That is why I do not do it.”

I liked her spunk and asked about her childhood. She told me life was hard in the countryside growing up. She had two older sisters and her bother did not come until later. In the course of our conversation, she dropped a detail that opened my eyes about the female infanticide and abandonment that had plagued Chinese rural areas for so much of China’s history. 

*****
Americans often asked me about Chinese female abandonment to orphanages. But even I had never fully understood why having sons was so important to a rural family. I assumed it had something to do with rural people’s feudalistic mythology that boys were better than girls and families needed boys to carry the lineage. That was true. But according to this masseuse, it was much more pragmatic than that. 

Her father worked the hardest every year during the time he had to turn in grain quotas. Her village was far from the town where they had to transport the grain. They had no motorized vehicles. Her father had to pull a wooden cart piled high with bags of grain and walk all day to town. It was too far for him to come home the same night and he could not afford to get a bed in a local inn. He slept outside to mind his grains and wait in the queue for his turn to check the grains in. 

Everyone had to submit their grain at the same time, causing large crowds and much shoving and pushing. When it was his turn, he had to lift large bags of grains weighing more than sixty Jin and place them on the scale. He would anxiously hold his breath as he watched the examiner’s face while he cut open the bag to examine the grains inside. If the examiner was satisfied with the quality and quantity, her father sighed a sigh of relief. If the examiner was displeased, her father’s heart sunk because he had to haul everything back, air the grains in the sun and sieve through them more exactingly to meet quality requirements before hazarding another trip to the town and risking being turned back again. 

Even when the examiner passed him, he still had to pick up those heavy bags himself and put them on piles that were taller than him. This was work that required multiple male laborers but he did not have any sons so he had to do it all by himself. The thing she heard her father say most often was: ‘It would be so nice if someday we do not have to turn in these quotas.’” 

The masseuse’s story clarified for me the mundaneness behind the myth of male superiority. For a family where a strong back was survival, males were given the welcome mat. For a family where the greatest threat was bullies, males ruled. Uneducated villagers did not go to court to resolve conflicts. They relied on strong arms and boys filled the bill. 

Before the one child policy, people had more chances for boys simply by having more children. But with the one child policy, a rural family was doomed to poverty if the first child was a girl. The girl deprived the family of a male labor and added an extra mouth to feed. This was precisely why Chinese female infants were abandoned. If the family abandoned the female infant, they could still have another child legally and hope for a boy. Or they would risk violating the one child policy, have their babies aborted against their will, or their house bulldozed by the government. 

*****
Living in inescapable poverty, daughters from rural areas who weren’t aborted or orphaned-off faced two choices. They could marry a rural man and sweat alongside him in the backbreaking toil of the farm  and wait on her in-laws, or they could escape to the city to become migrant workers.

In 2000, Tamara Jacka, an Australian researcher who specializes in the rural women of China conducted a survey on why rural women left for the city.  She found a variety of responses. Twenty-four percent cited the backwardness of their hometown or their family poverty. Twenty-three percent cited having nothing to do at home. But Jacka found the most frequently cited reasons were "to develop myself"  (forty-nine percent), "to broaden my horizons" (thirty-eight percent), "to exercise independence" (thirty-three percent) and "for my education" (thirty percent).

With television and mobile devices spread to the countryside, these women saw a world beyond the country and even beyond China. They came to cities for a bigger and better life they knew they would never find in their home village or small town. But for many of these women, big dreams soured into larger disappointments. 

Backbreaking or not, migrant work was long and low-paying drudgery. Some women became ernai to escape abusive marriages to rural men and abusive in-laws. But the paths to equality and advancement were often blocked because they were rural and they were women. 

My research and Baichun’s stats had shown that few ernais have happy endings. Most of them were abandoned after enduring a life of loneliness, insecurity and shame. When they returned to their home village, their illegitimate children were humiliated by their neighbors, sometimes even their own family. Some of them became drug addicts and insane due to physical and emotional abuse. But on the horizon of life options, being an ernai could still seem a win-win when there was no better alternative. The hours, pay, and material quality of life were better. And she could send excess money back home to afford her parents more mianzi and her brother a marriage –important duties of a filial daughter. 

## Chapter 29                  Urban Desire 

Baichun’s stories fascinated me and we sat in his office and talked late into the night. He confided in me that his divorce, contrary to Internet rumors, was not caused by his representing ernai but by his infidelity. He had married his wife, a decade younger and beautiful, out of vanity and lust. But they were intellectually incompatible. When he met a married businesswoman his age who was attractive and urbane, he fell in love. She coached him on how to dress, eat, and speak befitting his station and Baichun was an eager student. A rural boy, even after living in cities for years, he welcomed the hand of a cultured city  woman. Unlike his wife who had treated his parents marginally, this woman deferred to his parents, which Baichun appreciated as a great feminine virtue. When his wife caught Baichun and this woman in their apartment, she went ballistic and threatened Baichun with a knife. When Baichun tried to grab the knife, his wife slashed his hand. The marriage ended.

But to keep her mianzi, her lover elected to remain married to a husband she no longer loved. She also did not want to leave cosmopolitan Guangzhou for provincial Liuan where Baichun had his business. After a few years of a long distance relationship, Baichun longed for new passion. His lover was aging and he wanted a “tight vagina and taut body” in love making. “But I will take good care of her financially if I leave her,” Baichun assured me, taking pride in being an honorable man who would take care of his woman.    

He confessed that living in a different city from his married lover limited his access to sex. His social standing and notoriety forbade him from visiting prostitutes. If he was caught and exposed it would cause scandal and destroy his reputation as a champion of women. He also worried about contracting AIDS. Probably misinformed by the Chinese Internet, he harbored mythical phobias about being able to contract AIDS through skin contact. To set the record straight, I told him AIDS was only transmittable through bodily fluids. If he used a condom, he should be safe. 

I asked Baichun why not just find a girlfriend. He told me he dared not unless he was serious about getting married. Once involved with a man, Chinese women can become attached and expect marriage. Should the man leave, she can demand large sums of “parting” money. Baichun knew he had to tread cautiously because of his notoriety. But more importantly, he was still shaken by his ex-wife’s rage over his infidelity. The scar on his hand from his wife’s knife was a permanent reminder of that. 

He told me some women he represented wanted him to keep them. A twenty-one year old student offered to sleep with him twice a week throughout her college years for two thousand Yuan a month, “She gave me her account number for me to wire the money. Pretty girl. I couldn’t. She was so young,” Baichun reminisced. “I would not have minded helping her out, but I could not sleep with her. She was furious with me because I turned her down,” Baichun said with a sad smile.

Then out of the blue, Baichun said: “I am going to tell you something but you must turn your recorder off.” My ears perked up. 

Most ernais Baichun represented were poor, and sometimes all he was paid were meals and travel expenses. When he traveled to other cities for a case, some ernais would ask him to stay in their apartment to save hotel expenses. In a few instances, the women offered him sex. Baichun understood there was more to their offer than saving money. They had been abandoned by their lovers and had not found other men to meet their sexual needs; and many of these women suffered low self-esteem, believing their bodies were their only asset. 

“I said no. It would be scandalous for an ernai lawyer to sleep with ernais,” Zheng said self-mockingly. “But some of them were very attractive and I succumbed to temptation, like the one from Zhengzhou; what a pretty girl, nice body, twenty-three,” Baichun recalled with longing. , Baichun regaled me in great detail about his sexual experience with this woman. I listened with rapt attention.

At two in the morning when I got up to leave, Baichun said: “I so wish I could hold you.” I was surprised by his request and did not know what to say. I smiled, said goodbye, and returned to my room. Before I fell asleep, I wondered what Baichun wanted from me. The following morning, when I called him about meeting for breakfast, he asked to come to my room. It became clear Baichun wanted me. I wanted only a professional relationship with him. But in order not to offend him, I decided it was best to play dumb. I told him I was just out of a shower and would meet him in the lobby.

At breakfast Baichun acted more formally than usual, probably feeling embarrassed about his advances and my rebuff. I made small talk to soften the situation. Out of nowhere, Baichun asked: “Do you have a sex partner?”

“Generally I was not with a man just for sex. But I had boyfriends.”

“What is the difference between a boyfriend and a sex partner?”

“In my opinion, with a boyfriend one could share emotional and mental connection; with a sex partner, just sex.” 

“Is it common for Americans to have sex partners?”

“I am not sure but most people I know have girlfriends and boyfriends relationships and were not together solely for sex. Sometimes those relationships resulted in marriage, sometimes not but during the time they were together, I think the relationships comprised more than just sex.”
“Why didn’t you marry any of your American boyfriends?”

I told him the reasons varied from differences in values, to cultural and gender gaps. Some men were possessive and controlling, especially the ones with wealth. I did not want to give up my independence and become a subordinate. The dynamics were similar to those between an ernai and her patron, only those men were single, and the women accepted their control while I didn’t. 

“Why were those men single?” Baichun asked. 

“Some were divorced and some never married.” 

“Never married? Did they have some kind of problem?” Baichun’s pursued further.
I told Baichun these men may have a big ego or were selfish but as far as I knew they did not have “problems.” Some waited to marry because they were preoccupied with their career, or simply wanted to enjoy bachelorhood a while longer. I understood where Baichun where coming from. Even with the so-called sexual revolution in China, most Chinese men and women still settled into a traditional marriage before a certain age. Sexual promiscuity and infidelity were extracurricular activities outside of marriage. Those who remained unmarried past a certain age were suspected to have hidden “defects.” 

“What happened when you and the boyfriend broke up?” Baichun asked.  

“We just broke up,” I said, “When it worked, we stayed together; when it didn’t, we parted our ways. No parting fees.”

 “Maybe I should find an American woman,” Baichun said. 

“Maybe I should find a Chinese boyfriend,” I said. We both laughed. 
    
*****

Baichun remarked on the beauty of one of my female employees when I showed him some of my photos from America. Kimberly had ample bosoms and creamy white skin -- both were emblems of female beauty highly valued by Chinese men. 
“But don’t the white people smell?” Baichun asked. 

I have heard this before. Some Chinese thought Caucasians had stronger body odor than Asians. Chinese called it “Foreign Stink” and considered it an illness that requires treatment. 

I told Baichun it might be true that some Americans had a stronger body odor than Chinese. But everyone I knew in America showered frequently and used deodorant. 

“So you do not think their body odor would negatively impact love making?” Baichun remained unconvinced. I assured Baichun with deodorant, it would not be a problem. Upon his request, I wrote down “deodorant” on a piece of paper for him. 

When Xiaoqiang asked me about S&M, I did not know what it was. “I can’t believe you do not know S&M,” Xiaoqiang said, “It originated from America.” In his mind, the “fashionable and vanguard” people practiced or at least knew about fashionable and vanguard things. And many of those things came from America. Living in America, how could I not know S&M?

Almost every Chinese person I talked to about ernai and infidelity asked me: “Why are you writing about this in China? Isn’t it more common in America? Look at Bill Clinton.” “Sex and the City” made Chinese think all American women were as sexually promiscuous as the women in the TV series.

Whether Americans stank more than Chinese, practiced S&M, or were more promiscuous were not the only misconceptions that average Chinese had about America. Granted, some Americans had fetishes for swinging, group sex, or S&M, etc., and the American society largely tolerated them. But tolerance did not mean prevalence. Despite the Internet and the infusion of western influence into China, language barriers and time lag still caused many facts, figures, and nuances of America culture to get lost in translation. Many Chinese believed Americans still practiced “free sex” from the American sexual revolution of the 60’s and 70’s. In fact many blamed the current “sexual revolution” in China on the influence of the west, namely America. They did not know that because of the AIDS scare, Americans, generally speaking, had abandoned “free sex” for a safer approach. I knew many faithful American men and women who saw infidelity and sexual promiscuity as distasteful and problematic.  

My research showed that America couldn’t be fully “credited” for China’s current sexual revolution. The Chinese sexual revolution had its own characteristics rooted deeply in China’s traditional values on marriage, women, childbirth, sex and health. While S&M might have been an America import, most of what counted as sex and sexual in China originated from within.

*****

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Suiming Pan, a Professor at Renmin University and an expert on attitude change about sex in China, conducted a nationwide survey on sexual practices in China. Pan concluded from the survey that China had undergone a sexual revolution since the early 1990s. But the sexual revolution in China could not be easily compared to the sexual revolution of America and Western Europe in the 1960s. In the West, sexuality was a characteristic of an individual and the libidinous desire he or she could arouse in others. In China, sex and sexuality were characteristics of households, whose success was measured by the number of boys produced. A man or woman’s sexual magnetism had no corresponding concept in Chinese. There has never been a Chinese word that precisely translates the English word “sexuality”, though “xing” 性 is the Chinese word now commonly used to refer to “sex” in the western sense. Ironically, the two parts that made up the Chinese character is “person” and “birth,” which ties sex back to giving birth.    
According to Pan, from China’s earliest feudalist history to the infusion of modernist thinking about women’s place in the May Fourth Movement of 1919, the Chinese household adhered steadfastly to eight principles about sex and sexuality:

(1) Reproduction is the primary reason for sex

(2) Women exist for male pleasure

(3) Sex is a marital obligation  

(4) Mutual respect trumps romantic love as a reason for sex 

(5) Male heirs, not pleasure, is the main reason for sexual activity

(6) Excessive sex can harm male health

(7) Sex is legitimate behavior but discussing it is not

(8) Sex needs to stay private because gossip can shame

These principles reinforce one another but can be reduced to two basic tenets: Sex is for reproduction, and the highest priorities in sex after the birth of sons are to ensure the men’s pleasure, health, and privacy.

Beginning 1981, the association of sex with male reproduction began to collapse with the one child policy. To make the policy effective, the government made contraceptives and abortions easily available. Forty nine percent of urban women and twenty-nine percent of rural women below the age of forty had at least one abortion.   Women on contraceptives reported enjoying sex over twice as much as women who did not take them because it reduced their fear of pregnancy. The one-child policy had inadvertently elevated the idea of sex for pleasure for both men and women. 

The one-child policy also significantly reduced the years of child-rearing and made couples empty nesters in fewer years. People fear having affairs most because they hurt the children at home. With the children gone, fear about extra-marital affairs and even divorce decreases. The one-child policy also brought an increase of nuclear families, families who don’t live with older generations getting into their business. Eighty-six per cent of married couples under the age of forty-five lived in nuclear arrangements. With only one child in the household, the need for live-in grandparents to care for the children diminished.

In sum, the one-child policy relaxed China’s traditional identification of sexuality and reproduction to accommodate a more modern sexual and romantic frame. But the traditional identification of sexuality with reproduction never lost its grip. Notions of sexuality in modern China splintered. And when the two frames came into conflict, the public usually sided with the traditional frame. This was reflected in Chinese’s people’s hatred towards ernai and xiaosan. 

The anti-ernai articles I read on the Internet were suddenly making sense to me. Despite a growing interest in romantic love as a bond between couples, ernai still offended the public morality of the Chinese household and received little public sympathy.

*****

Public morality notwithstanding, Pan learned that the under forty generation in China was showing a marked preference for the romance frame. People over forty did not regard sexual intimacy a necessity for marriage. But those under forty considered it so essential that without it, they would most likely seek out extra-marital partners. 

And here we come full circle to the more interesting half of Pan’s point: Had the new frame of romance introduced through mistresses and infidelity in the 1980s been powerful enough to undermine the old frame of household marriage, one would expect divorce in China to have climbed at a much higher rate. But instead of divorce, men chose to contract ernai - the second wife and set up a second household. Ernai represented a conservative backlash to a culture of mistresses that threatened marriage in China and “paradoxically highlighted the continued importance of marriage in China because it constituted a kind of imitation marriage.” 

Ernai on this interpretation arose as a compromise between a modern notion of sexuality that flaunted romance and a traditional notion that hid sexuality under the motive of producing sons. The tension is evident at events like the 11th annual “Guangzhou National Sex Culture Festival” held in November 2013 that filled the Guangzhou Exposition Center with strawberry-flavored condoms, aphrodisiacs, fishnet lingerie, naughty nurse costumes, bikini-clad models, porn stars from Japan, and anatomically correct sex dolls that sold from 8 dollars to life size inflatable dolls costing $6,400 that warmed with contact and could be customized to a man’s tastes. The festival was showing off a home grown industry, as more than 1000 Chinese companies generate more than 70% of the world’s sex toys that reaped in 2 billion dollars in 2010.  As the New York Times reported it, the festival targeted Guangzhou’s mostly male population of 30 million migrant workers looking for unrequited love. Yet the raunch was balanced by priggish family values conservatism. The festival theme was “Happy Sex, Happy Families” and the government, which officially bans pornography and opposes “licentiousness” as an enemy of the family, sponsored booths on medical health that were passed by.

China’s sexual revolution had developed not in opposition to family values but under its banner. The ernai phenomenon extended sexual freedom and family values at the same time. It upheld the traditional Chinese marital household by spinning out a second secret household imitating the first. Men who under one-child policy conceived at most one son (and often none) in the first household could tap the second household for more sons. New configurations of sexuality were being deployed to support old traditions.

Xiaosan and ernai occupied this transitional space between the household and romantic frames.  The generations of men partaking in ernai and xiaosan were deeply committed to the romance frame. But they remained conventional in their thinking and too fearful of public ridicule to fully abandon the household frame. Within the modernist gender-blind Judeo-Christian ethic of American marriage, if married man or woman wanted extra-marital romance, either could divorce without shame. The shame would come if either broke faith with the spouse and committed adultery. But within a Chinese culture transitioning between household and romantic frames, if a married man wanted romance, he started a second household to seal his romance within an imitation “marriage.” A divorced man, Baichun fell through the cracks of both sides of this transition. His married lover would not leave her marriage for him to remain in a household: and Baichun hesitated to get sexually involved with any of his abandoned clients because it was outside of a household frame. 

*****

Baichun’s lover did not divorce her husband, but research on marital infidelity by Yuantin Zhang drawn from Pan’s national survey, suggested she did not fit the dominant pattern of women in China who cheated. Zhang found that in general married women who stray threaten the conjugal household more than married men. This is because married women in China will not cheat unless they are unhappy in their marriage and desperate to leave; whereas married men cheat even when they are happily married and have no intention of leaving their wives. Men straying from happy marriages befuddled me as well as the chatroom women involved with married lovers. These women assumed the men cheated for excitement, fun, sex and status, while I suspected deeper reasons like seeking emotional security and relief from stress. 

The conditions of extra-marital infidelity in China that Zhang found resembled many of the stories I had read and witnessed, whether the mistress was married or not. The men were older, more established, attracted to the woman’s youth and education (making her a woman of quality), and made sure the women had the resources to travel and rendezvous on a regular basis if she did not command these resources on her own. 

Zhang found age makes a difference among male and female cheaters. The peak of female cheating is the 20s with a sharp decline in the 30s. The peak of male cheating is the 30s with a slower decline into the 40s and 50s.  Education proved another differentiating factor between male and female cheaters. A college education is not a factor in the profile of men who cheat, but it is a factor in the profile of women cheaters. One interpretation is that education makes a woman aware of larger doors of opportunity and draws her to refined men who can help open these doors for her. Conversely, she will be more likely to stray if the man she married does not share her horizons and is not supportive of her search for better opportunities. 

But occupational status and income were part of the profile of the male cheater. Urban managers and professionals were more likely to cheat than poorly paid rural laborers or farmers. Men who couldn’t afford an apartment or car were not good candidates for affording an affair, but they could afford massages, prostitutes, and an assortment of “adult health products” sold in sex shops and over the Internet.  The Chinese sex industry, whose initial focus was export, increased its domestic consumption from poor and rural migrant workers who often could not afford wives, much less mistresses. The rich and poor gap  exacerbated the problem caused by the high ratio of men to women in China. Men at the bottom of the food chain could not afford to have one woman while men at the top had more women than they could handle. 

Occupational status proved a less relevant factor in the profile of women who cheat. But regardless of their level of salaried income, married men and married women who cheat required a high enough monthly income, earned, inherited, or gifted, to travel and spend significant time away from home and work. This demonstrated that in modern day China, like pricey housing, luxury brands and other privileges forbidden to common people, sex and romance had become luxury consumptions that only the well to do could afford. 

It was the law of the jungle – the alpha male with resources and power rules, while women become “consumables” based on their physical beauty, youth, education and other feminine attributes. Both Chinese men and women wanted to get ahead but “getting ahead” would mean different things. For a man, it meant acquiring the power and resources to afford a household for one woman – or more; for a woman, it meant having the quality to arouse a man’s desire and join his household, either as a wife or ernai. A scooter driver in Hu Chiming City summed up the male challenge succinctly for me when I asked him why he was single. He told me: “No money, no honey.”

Baichun told me when he started his business, he had to surrender his lawyer license because in China lawyers and government officials were not allowed to own businesses. The concern was conflict of interest. Lawyers and officials are supposed to defend the public interest and entering the private sector could motivate them to bend the law to their own benefit. Obviously Chinese can bribe their way around any policy. With bribes, lawyers can find ways to represent clients without a license, and officials can start businesses and put the ownership in the name of their spouse, children, or extended relatives. But the fact Baichun, a lawyer who loved his profession and believed in his cause, had to become a businessman to make money, signified how important money is in China. It buys not only food, shelter, and mianzi, but sex and love. 

In Baichun I saw a paradox of rural and urban, new and old, modernity and tradition. Though educated and resourceful, he lived under stress of financial uncertainty and moral constraints. And despite China’s sexual revolution and the hullabaloo surrounding it, Baichun, a healthy, divorced middle-aged man of some prominence, was not getting enough sex.

## Chapter 30                   California  

In modern day China, love comes with a price tag and the law of the jungle ruled. Alpha males with money have a limitless choice of women while the small potatoes get crumbs. I had long been acquainted with this dynamic running a business in California. 

In Orange County, posh parties went on every night in bars and clubs, beach houses, and on private yachts. The subtext of the party was always money and sex. Rich men looked for youth and beauty and beautiful and not so beautiful women looked for money. 

My friend Marcia once took me to a black tie party in a modern mansion sitting on top Laguna hill. With a stunning view of the Pacific Ocean, sprawling bars and pools on multi levels, it was a perfect party spot. Women with perfect bodies and faces in expensive designer dresses came in on the arms of men who looked to be “heavy hitters.” But it was the most boring party I ever attended. No one talked to Marsha and me. They were too busy getting drunk and stoned, or remaining absorbed in their own specialness. The women only offered the tips of their fingers when they shook my hand, if they shook my hand. And any man who talked to Marcia and me was soon pulled away by his date. The entire evening felt like a stage show permeating in the smell of weed with moving mannequins. Marcia told me many of those women were models, actresses, or call girls (they could all mean the same thing). Some of them became rich men’s girlfriends or mistresses for a while before getting dumped for a younger model. That was why they were unfriendly to Marsha and me. They lived off their beauty and viewed other attractive women as competition. 

In Orange County and LA, a woman’s beauty was her calling card. The web designer for our business, Cathy, told me about her experience in LA as a lawyer. “Everybody wears black and no one looks at you. They are too cool to say hello.” Cathy was average looking and in her late thirties. She told me that a woman of average looks or over forty was practically invisible in the LA social scene. I first thought Cathy was exaggerating her bad experience, but LA locals confirmed her impressions. At LA art show, I asked everyone who walked through our booth where they were from. Many from LA hid their roots because they were aware LA people had a reputation of being shallow and vain, and they wanted to avoid those associations. Kathy eventually quit practicing law and moved to OC to become a web designer. But her move did not improve her social life. She still could not get dates. 

While men sized women up on their looks, women sized men up on their wealth. Marcia used to take me bar hopping. As soon as we pulled in a parking lot, she surveyed the cars parked there. If she saw a Ferrari, Bentley, or Maserati, she would go in and look for the owners; but if she only saw generic brands, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, she drove me to the next destination. Once in, she talked to any man she thought was rich and expected them to buy us drinks and food. Since I was with Marcia, I was often stuck listening to men trying to impress me with their diamond-studded gold Rolexes, their private jets, their yachts, or a trip around the world in first class to entice me. These men were brash, many decades older than me, and I dismissed their advances as preposterous. But after leaving their company, I would see them hitting on women younger than me.

Having lived in OC for years, John knew this dynamic intimately. 

A successful entrepreneur and a good-looking man in his mid forties, he was never married and had no girlfriend. In Orange County, beautiful women went only for superrich men; though a millionaire, John’s wealth dwarfed among the heavy hitters. The women he was interested in rejected him for not being rich enough; and those who were interested in him were either too “old” or too plain for him. To John, dating an average looking woman was like wearing shabby shoes. It was an admission that he was small potatoes. If he couldn’t afford the most expensive shoes, he’d prefer to go barefoot. 

After I got to know John better, I understood he championed my independence from rich men for a personal reason. He deemed me just as hot as the OC hotties. But I bucked the “beautiful women gold digger” trend he resented. With me as an ally, John felt he had found a weapon to avenge the women who rejected him and the men who won them over. He loved rubbing elbows with the moneyed crowd and encouraged me to mingle with the rich for business. But when a wealthy man approached me at a club or picked me up for a date from his house, he informed them of my curfew and made them pay deference to him as my business partner. My friend Kevin, who saw how John interacted with me at different events, called John my pimp.

With Chinese contemporary art booming, John had big dreams for our business. He hoped it would make him a “heavy hitter” of glamor and wealth and bring me financial independence. On our walks around the island, John would jazz me: “I can’t wait to send you big fat checks from the business so you can buy your own beach house and Ferrari, and tell the rich assholes pursuing you to go to hell.” 

But behind the glamour, the art business is a tough business.  Not even the wealthy need art as they need food or clothes. Our art sold for the kind of money most people use to buy a car, pay for their children’s college, or a down payment on a house. Dealing Chinese art posed an additional challenge. With no benchmarks in America, I couldn’t prove the value of our art to my American clients, nor could I translate the notoriety of the artists in China into American fame. Buyers were intrigued by the cultural intricacies of our art, but except for the savvy few, most people hesitated to buy art by an unknown artist. The overheated Chinese art market compounded our challenge. Anticipating a bursting real estate bubble, Chinese nouveau riche turned to art as an investment. This made Chinese artists of any repute a hot commodity. Western dealers and Chinese patrons raked through artist villages, art institutions, and auction houses in China searching for talent. The artists I wanted to represent were heavily courted if not already “taken.” Sometimes artists agreed to work with us for foreign gilding. But even so, the most talented artists imposed steep terms. 

Facing these challenges, John raised the pressure both on himself and on me to “sell.” He importuned me hard to sell to rich men who were interested in me. “You’ve got the world by the short-hair,” he would say to me, “If I tried to reach those guys, I wouldn’t get past their secretaries. But they would do anything for Lily. Why not take advantage of it and sell them some art?” To egg me on, John recounted with admiration how Diana, an attractive blond sales woman from another gallery in Laguna, sold dozens of paintings effortlessly to rich admirers. I knew men did not buy paintings from Diana for nothing. They expected a return. For the deal to work, Diana had to mislead the man or throw herself in – somehow -- as a bonus.  

John’s proposal made me indignant. Even were I to play the flirtation game, I was wary of the drill. Too many times men had promised me the moon, only to shut the door in my face after I “rejected” them. Over the years I have learned that a pretty face is an interchangeable commodity a man can easily dispose. I couldn’t believe that John, once a supporter of my independence, wanted me to sell my affection for business. John apparently distinguished marrying a rich man for money and using female charm to sell art to him; to me, they were the same. And when I did meet some rich men I wanted to date at the sales pitches John set up, John reacted possessively. He worried I would get distracted, marry one of them, and abandon the business. 

John’s friend Monty was friends with Steve, a tech entrepreneur who had just sold his company for a fortune, and bought a showcase mansion on the Pacific Ocean. John was determined to turn Steve into a client. He asked Monty to arrange a dinner with Steve and strategically sat me next to him. Steve did buy a painting from us; but he was more interested in me. And I was interested in him. 

When I met Steve, I thought I had at long last met my match. Steve was the epitome of the American dream. He had come from a working class family and put himself through college.  At forty, he had built and sold a company that left him wealthy beyond his dreams. I admired Steve for his success. But more than his money, I admired him for his discipline and resolve. He reminded me of me, willful, fearless, and self-made. He told me how he had put everything he owned into his business and lived with unrelenting stress for five years to build it. It was sink or swim and he succeeded on sheer determination. I shared with him my disgust for sleazy rich men who approached me and he shared his distaste for shallow gold diggers who tried to land him. We were thrilled to learn how much we shared and plunged into a whirlwind romance. With Steve I learned how romance and money complemented one another. Romance thrives on the elegant and beautiful, and wealth insulates lovers from the mundane and the unsightly. In this world of refinement and fantasy, everything turned electric.
As I spent more time with Steve, John turned increasingly nervous. He had grown to detest Steve. When Steve first met me, he befriended John to get John’s blessing to court me. But once our relationship was under way, he snubbed John’s initiatives to “bud up” with him. Steve no doubt saw John as social rungs below him. John never forgave Steve for this rebuff and his grudge created tension around my relationship with Steve. Knowing I hated people who did drugs, John, on Monty’s hearsay, informed me that Steve was a cokehead. 

But John never needed to worry. I knew early on I would never ditch the business for Steve. Despite my heart’s yearnings, my mind saw clearly that Steve was not a man I could marry. Financial security aside, I needed emotional security in a relationship. I needed a man who was kind and generous, and someone who would handle my heart gently. 

Though he came from humble roots, Steve came to regard himself as royalty. He demanded special treatment from wait staff, expected the world to cater to him, and became “intense” when things did not go his way. He expected no less from me. He asked that I drive from OC to LA to meet him for a date, in John’s car, after flying cross-country from Pittsburgh to OC; I was so turned off by his presumptuousness, I canceled the date.  After agreeing to help the business by buying a painting, he bargained hard on the price with John and put me in the middle. For every romantic dinner or trip he paid for, he expected affection in return and carped when he felt shortchanged. Steve had few friends and saw socializing a waste of time unless it furthered his business or personal interests. He would spend thousands of dollars on a bottle of wine, but would not foot a few hundreds dollars for a hotel room for his grandmother’s husband. The old man was attending to his sick wife in the hospital away from home. To save money, he had been sleeping in his car. 
After I informed Steve of my decision to stop seeing him, he shut me out completely. Years later when I was stuck in the LA airport and needed a ride I called Steve, hoping that time had softened the old grudges. Steve never returned my call. In his mind, anyone who dared reject him had committed an unpardonable crime. 

After Steve I dated another rich Orange County man, Robert, the owner of a law firm. Robert was born into a rich Cuban family with plantations and servants. When the revolution broke out, the Communists confiscated his family wealth and jailed his father. To escape persecution, his father moved his family to America. Now poor and cut off from his roots, his father became a bitter and broken man. None of Robert’s older siblings went to college. They all worked menial jobs. But Robert worked hard and made it big. I admired his drive and his discipline. His immigrant experience resonated with me. But insecure about his poor immigrant background, he felt he had to flaunt his wealth with me like other Orange County men. It worked on many OC women. He assumed it would work for me. Had he just been his smart, witty and pragmatic self, I probably could have fallen in love. But with all his affectation, I couldn’t find a place to root my feelings. 

When I met Jerry in Pittsburgh, I thought I finally met a man that I could “settle down with.” Jerry was small potatoes financially compared to Steve or Robert, but he was accomplished in his own way. Born in a working class family, he exceled in school, attended Harvard on scholarship, and accumulated a small fortune from a business executive’s salary, frugal living, and shrewd investments. Unlike the pompous rich men I had previously encountered, Jerry endeared himself to me with his “nerdiness” and boyish charm. He fretted not being good-looking and rich enough for me.  But tired of the flash of OC men, I saw Jerry as a welcome change. My resolve after my divorce to love from my heart had only brought disappointment and chaos. I decided it was time to bring realism back into romance. Though he could be needy and petty and was not particularly attractive, I convinced myself he would make a good husband. He was “boring,” but safe.

Starting in the fall of 2007, the housing market in America slowed down and a recession was in the wind. People feared devaluation of their homes, stocks, and retirement, and tightened their purse strings. The sales at the gallery slowed dramatically. Heavily invested in the gallery both financially and emotionally, John upped the pressure on himself and me to “pull through.” 

A self-proclaimed “entrepreneur with eyes for golden opportunities,” John set out to find inventive ways to make money. Through a friend of friends, John landed a deal to sell a twenty million dollar Picasso painting that came with a backstory weaved in tall tales. He was thrilled at the opportunity to make a high commission while I suspected the painting a forgery. John talked through my caution and tried to guilt me into committing: “Just think how many paintings we have to sell to make $2 million? This is a great opportunity to make some quick cash. You are my partner; you are supposed to back me on everything I do.” The Picasso deal turned out to be a flop, but John continued to partner with shady characters in the art business to sell phantom art, and interpreted my hesitation to participate as a lack of “commitment.” He “pep talked” me on long walks about dedicating myself more to business and insisted we do everything together, business or social, even when one of us could handle it alone. 

John’s constant prodding felt like a dark cloud over my head and his stress became my stress. Gradually I dreaded spending time with him. I couldn’t help feeling a creeping irritation with a low-grade resentment. I could not pinpoint the source of my feelings and blamed myself for them. John was the same dedicated business partner, the thoughtful roommate, and the protective big brother. How could I feel this way when he always accommodated me, treated me with thoughtfulness, and looked out for our best interests? I told myself I should just get along. But it was a feeling I couldn’t shake. 

An American art agent Lenny Shaw deepened the rift between John and me. Ten years earlier at the beginning of the Chinese art boom, Lenny ventured to China and signed exclusive contracts with many Chinese artists before they became famous. He promised us access to them. I mistrusted Lenny because he evaded my questions, used fear as a sales tactic, and bait and switch in deals. But Lenny’s lack of integrity did not faze John. John told me he had been in business all his adult life and most business people were like Lenny. I might as well get used to it. 

To appease John, I went along with Lenny until he turned on two artists he represented. He sued one artist after his contract expired to retain control over him; and defaulted on paying another after selling his paintings for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Both artists turned to me for help. A lawyer friend ran a background check on Lenny that turned up hundreds of court settlements against him for defaults on payment. I was sickened by my findings and wanted to bring Lenny to justice on behalf of the Chinese artists. But John did not share my indignation. He shook his head in acknowledgment but warned me against offending Lenny just in case “we need him for business.” Lenny was a criminal who took advantage of innocent people; how could John think of doing business with him?  

My confidence in John’s judgment plummeted. I was furious at him for pimping me to rich men for sales and putting me through phantom deals. By a Chinese saying, John had “let the profit and greed smoke his heart black.” When John first met me, he was jaded by the greed of Orange County gold diggers and people in business. He was refreshed by my untainted outlook on life. But instead of reviving himself on my optimism, he wanted me to adopt his cynicism. When John’s eighty-year old mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, John was shaken and chocked up talking about it. But when I encouraged him to close the gallery for a limited time and return to Pittsburgh to care for her, he refused. With business down, he couldn’t divert his attention, he said. I could applaud his decision as dedication to the business but I could not help seeing it as callousness. Over the years of my partnership with John, I had come to see that John put money above people. I started to doubt our partnership and retreated to Pittsburgh to think things over. A near fatal car accident on a business trip in Tucson forced me to examine my life and our partnership. 

At rush hour, while being on the phone and driving at the same time, I pulled my rental out into a busy intersection without looking. A white Honda crashed into the hood of my car at 70 miles per hour and totaled it. Had I pulled out a couple of seconds sooner, the Honda would have crashed into the driver door with me inside. 

Rattled, I called Tom and Tommy about the accident. The next day, Tom told me Tommy was visibly upset and retreated to his room the rest of the evening. Hearing I had upset Tommy brought tears to my eyes. After my divorce I had sought the multi-tasking fast lane, and tried to fit in as many people, places, work, and fun as I could. But wanting to miss out on nothing had made me miss out on everything, especially those who were most important to me – Tommy.

Shuttling between east coast to west and to China, I had been a ghost of a mother for Tommy. On his first day of school, I was on a month long business trip in China. I felt pangs of sadness when I looked at Tommy’s photos when he was five, six, and seven. I was in none of them and he was wearing clothes I didn’t buy. The guilt of neglecting Tommy gnawed at me. But I justified my sacrifice as a prerequisite to success. I worked for the payday when I could take Tommy on fancy trips around the world and give him everything my parents couldn’t give me. But in this moment all I had averted my eyes from caught up with me and brought my guilt to a head. My life decisions had made Tommy’s world less secure and my recklessness had shaken it further. 

Tommy was growing up fast. I knew I needed to spend more time with him before it was too late. More importantly, I needed to do an inventory of my life. In my earnest pursuit for “success,” my life had turned into a whirlwind that passed me by like the landscape on a speeding train. It had left a series of fragmented blurs but no lasting impression. Whatever my pursuit was at the moment, obtaining it only brought temporary satisfaction. And the more I pursued, the more I felt empty. Business had been slow and it made sense for me to reduce my flights and spend more time in Pittsburgh. My decision did not sit well with John and the tension between us mounted. It further intensified when Jerry and I started talking about marriage. John feared if I married Jerry, I would abandon him and the business. It saddened me to recall the days John and I talked for hours about our shared hopes and dreams for business and life.  

*****
To form a perfect storm, come 2008, the market sub-prime mortgage went belly-up. The stock market took a blood-letting. Every day the news was filled with business failures, bankruptcies, job losses, and foreclosures. Orange County with its inflated real estate was hit hard and sobriety replaced extravagance. Several of the “moneyed” people from the gym had their houses foreclosed and moved farther inland. People stopping working out with trainers and one high end restaurant after another in Laguna shuttered up. The gallery was one of countless small businesses in America battered by the market crash. For six months in 2008, we sold no paintings. But our landlord, employees, the utilities companies expected payment just the same. Risking my perfect credit scores, I opened credit cards in my name to juggle the gallery expenses. 

John had invested heavily in the business and kept the rest of his money in the stock market. With both the business and the stock market down, John was beside himself with panic. He pushed me to find ways to keep the gallery afloat. I worried as much as John about the business but my upbringing made me inured to lean times. When I first moved to America, the first friends I made were poor Chinese college students who worked in Chinese restaurants illegally. They came to America with nothing but managed to survive and put themselves through school. During my divorce and when I faced uncertainty in a job situation, I drew inspiration from those students. I also knew the economy was cyclical and the bad times would eventually pass. I shared the stories of those students and my optimism with John. I reminded him the whole economy was faltering and our lack of sales was not our fault. But John took my refusal to panic as a sign I did not care. He felt abandoned by me in time of crisis. If we went belly up, I had Jerry to bail me out, how about him?

Even with all my doubts about the partnership I wanted to save the business as much as John did. We tried different strategies to stay afloat but nothing worked. We talked about closing the gallery, subleasing the building, and selling the business. As John was stationed in OC, it fell to him to make it happen. But he never did. After numerous conversations and no action, I realized John had no intention of closing the business. 

One day out of the blue, John informed me he planned to take over the business. As he put it to me, the business “was not worth much” and I “had lost interest in it.” I was flabbergasted. Even with little cash, we had valuable inventory. And I owned 51% of the business. How could he “take it over” from me? I felt betrayed by John’s request. The gallery, the baby we nurtured for years, was dying. It sucked but it was nobody’s fault. Much of American business was tanking. I did not blame John; why was he blaming me? We tried to talk things out but it only hardened our positions and intensified the bad feelings.

To escalate the conflict, John hired a litigator to intimidate me into submitting. He took my name off our joint business bank account and went AWOL on me. He stopped paying the artists for the paintings sold and refused to return their unsold paintings. Since I was their point of contact, the artists came to me for help. But I could do nothing. I had friends who bought art from us and stored them at the gallery. With John out of reach, they worried about losing their paintings. I became the Lenny to my artists and friends. The business account had been paying the business credit card debt in my name; after John stopped payment on the card, I had to pay it off. 

These events destroyed the trust John and I once shared and the friendship we had spent years building. It sickened me to watch our lawyers battle one another and exacerbate the conflict; what we spent on legal fees could have been used to salvage the business.  

I wanted to run away from this ordeal but every fiber of my being told me to dig in and stand up for myself. I remembered the bully on the train who intimidated mother and me and my creed to never back down from injustice. As a woman and an immigrant, I felt doubly screwed if I let John win. When John and his lawyer played hardball and refused to settle, I filed a claim against John in the United States Federal Court in Pittsburgh to regain control of the business. Weeks after I filed the claim, John filed a countersuit against me in Orange Country. 

***** 
After a brief honeymoon stage, my relationship with Jerry was on the rocks. My absence from Pittsburgh on business trips displeased him. He offered little support to ease my work stress but took my sullenness from it as rejection, and hit back with anger and sourness. He had wanted a chirpy girlfriend and when my burdens silenced my chirp, he felt cheated. 

Jerry was proud to be with me – what he called a  “complete package” desired by many, a validation of his “success” and status in life. But at the same time, my past relationships with wealthy suitors and boyfriends intimidated him and he was gnawed by a sense of inadequacy.  “You would never be with me had it not been for my money,” he would say to me. First I thought he was joking but after realizing he was not, I reminded him that if I wanted a rich man, I would have married men much richer than him. But my attempt to reassure him only deepened his insecurity. He turned jealous and controlling, monitored my outings with friends, and questioned my meeting new people, particularly men. His clinging turned me off and aloof, which deepened his insecurity. We fought endlessly and the fights drained me. I was already battling John, John’s lawyer and a failing business. I didn’t need to be battling the man who supposedly loved me. 

*****

The conflict came to a head when Jerry informed me he wanted a prenuptial agreement. We had talked about marriage at different times. But not once had he mentioned a pre-nuptial. I felt hurt and insulted. I assumed Jerry wanted a pre-nup because he was miserly and did not trust me. He also assumed I would never earn as much as he. I had encountered rich men who presumed I wanted them for their money and passed on them. I was determined to steer clear of the power imbalance, the philandering, and the endless temptation and suspicion that attend being with a man of incredible wealth. I chose Jerry in part because he wasn’t superrich, which would allow us to build a relationship based on equality. 

But now Jerry was making the same arrogant assumptions as the men I passed over. I recalled mother’s pain: “Why doesn’t your father trust me? Why is he treating me like an outsider? We had five children together!” The prospect of marrying a tightwad who did not trust me made my heart sink. 

Living in America for over a decade, I had tried to adapt American ways in sex, love, and marriage. But the idea of a pre-nuptial agreement eluded me. Whether I was Chinese or American, I still held the romantic version of marriage – two people in love and committed to a life together. A pre-nupt agreement turned everything cold and businesslike. It put a sour taste in my mouth. I would never quit my business and depend solely on a man for money. But the few years in the business world had made me weary. I longed for a soft pillow to rest my head on. I wanted security and stability back in my life. I thought Jerry would be a good source for that but he proved otherwise. He was selfish and self-protective. He had not lifted a finger to help with my struggling business. The pre-nup was the last straw. The fact Jerry snuck it on me at the last minute made it even worse. I saw him as sneaky as well as stingy.

The dashing lover I once admired was nothing more than a common worry-wart too niggling to risk for love. I told Jerry to shove his pre-nuptial agreement and his money. Days later Jerry begged me back offering an engagement without the pre-nupt. To prove his “generosity and commitment,” he even opened a joint account and promised to deposit one hundred thousand dollars into it. “You can use it however you want,” he encouraged me. At the last minute, he transferred forty thousand instead without explanation. I did not care about the money – I hadn’t asked for it in the first place. But I couldn’t forgive him for breaking his promise without bothering to notify me. I saw it as control.  It put the onus on me to ask what happened when the onus was on him to explain why he was still worthy of my trust. I broke up with him one more time. 
But the drama continued. Unable to let go, we rollercoastered through more rounds of breakup and makeup. But with each new round, resentment and hurt mounted. The drama caused me endless stress and I started to tire of the relationship. I grew bored with the regimen of dinner, show, charity-event every weekend with Jerry. For the duration of our relationship, we never cooked one meal together, washed dishes, or did laundry. Our relationship was an endless courting game. I realized without the distractions of the weekly entertainment, Jerry and I shared little intellectually or spiritually. Now without the protection of a pre-nupt, Jerry got cold feet about getting married. And without a common goal, I saw no future with him. But the prospect of leaving him remained unnerving, especially during this time of uncertainty with John and the business.
