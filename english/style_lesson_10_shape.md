Here are the principles for giving sentences a coherent shape:

1. Get quickly to the subject, then to the verb and its object:
    + Avoid long introductory phrases and clauses. Revise them into their own independent clauses.
    + Avoid long subjects. Revise a long subject into an introductory subordinate clause. (If the new introductory clause is long, shift it to the end of its sentence)
    + Avoid interrupting subjects and verbs, and verbs and objects. Move the interrupting element to either the beginning or end of the sentence, depending on what the next sentence is about
2. Open the sentence with its point in a short main clause stating the key claim that you want the sentence to make.
3. After the main clause, avoid adding one subordinate clause to another to another to another.
    + Trim relative clauses and break the sentences into two.
    + Extend a sentence with resumptive, summative, or free modifiers.
        + Resumptive: When we discovered the earth was not the center of the universe, it changed our understanding of who we are, **an understanding changed again by Darwin, again by Freud, and again by Einstein.** (repeat the subject another time)
        + Summative: American productivity has risen to new heights, **an achievement that only a decade ago was considered an impossible dream.**
        + Free: Global warming will become a central political issue of the twenty-first century, **raising questions whose answers will affect the standard of living in every Western nation.**
    + Coordinate elements that are **PARALLEL** both in grammar and in sense.
