## 总结

The qualities of elegance are too varied and subtle to capture in a summary. Nevertheless, elegant passages typically have three characteristics that may seem incompatible but are not:

+ the simplicity of characters as subjects and actions as verbs
+ the complexity of balanced syntax, meaning, sound, and rhythm
+ the emphasis of artfully stressed endings

You won't acquire an elegant style just by reading this book. You must read those who write elegantly until their style runs along your muscles and nerves. Only then can you look at your own prose and know when it is elegant or just inflated. To make that distinction, I think the only reliable rule is **Less is more**. Of the many graces of style, compression is still, I think, the first.
