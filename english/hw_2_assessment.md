## Text

**Background**

Restaurants (the term is being used interchangeably with “food service establishments” or “FSEs”) are an important source of daily food intake for New York City residents: an estimated one third of daily caloric intake comes from foods purchased in restaurants.1 Assuring safe and healthy dining options is a public health priority. The Department issues permits and inspects all New York City FSEs and non-retail food processing establishments, as defined in §81.03(j) and (p) of the Health Code. The public health concern addressed by this amendment is the presence of trans fat in foods served in restaurants, which represents a dangerous and entirely preventable health risk to restaurant goers. Yet New York City restaurant patrons currently have no practical way to avoid this harmful substance.

Accordingly, the Board of Health has amended Article 81 of the New York City Health Code to restrict the service of products containing artificial trans fats at all FSEs.

The Department is charged with preventing and controlling diseases, including chronic disease, through approaches that may address individual behavior or the community environment. By restricting FSEs from serving food that contains artificial trans fat, except for food served in the manufacturer’s original sealed package, we can reduce New Yorkers’ exposure to an avoidable hazard in the food environment that is associated with increased heart disease risk.

**Basis for restricting service of products containing artificial trans fat**

Heart disease is New York City’s leading cause of death. In 2004, 23,000 New York City residents died from heart disease and nearly one-third of these individuals died before the age of 75.2 Scientific evidence demonstrates a clear association between increased trans fat intake and the risk of coronary heart disease. Most dietary trans fat is found in partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (“PHVO”) - oil that has been chemically modified. Scientific studies which examine the change in cholesterol levels when trans fat is replaced with currently available heart healthy alternatives conservatively estimate a reduction of 6% in coronary heart disease events such as heart attacks.3 Even in the most conservative estimates, based on replacing trans fat primarily by saturated fat - an unlikely outcome given the widespread trend to healthier fats by food producers - a significant although smaller reduction in coronary heart disease events is still expected. Other scientific studies, based upon observing large groups of people over time estimate that up to 23% of coronary heart disease events could be avoided by replacing trans fat with healthy alternatives. Because an estimated one third of dietary trans fat comes from foods purchased in restaurants, the continued presence of PHVO in restaurant foods represents an important contribution to cardiovascular risk for New York City diners.

Dietary trans fat increases the risk of heart disease by elevating LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, and lowering HDL (“good”) cholesterol.5 Because of its negative effect on “good cholesterol”, trans fat appears to be even worse than saturated fat. The Institute of Medicine (“IOM”) reviewed the scientific evidence and concluded that there is “a positive linear trend between trans fatty acid intake and total and LDL concentration, and therefore increased risk of coronary heart disease”6. The 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, issued by the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), recommends that dietary intake of trans fat be “as low as possible”7 and the American Heart Association guidelines issued in June 2006 recommend that trans fat intake be kept below 1% of total energy intake.8 In January of 2006, the FDA’s mandatory listing of trans fat content on the nutrition facts labels of packaged foods came into effect.

Approximately 80% of dietary trans fat is found in industrially-produced PHVO, which is used for frying and baking and is present in many processed foods.10 Approximately 20% is naturally occurring and is found in small amounts in dairy and meat products from ruminant animals.

The artificial trans fat found in PHVO is produced when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil in a process called hydrogenation. Common FSE sources of artificial trans fat include: foods fried in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils; margarine and vegetable shortening; prepared foods such as pre-fried French fries, fried chicken, taco shells and donuts; baked goods such as hamburger buns, pizza dough, crackers, cookies, and pies; and pre-mixed ingredients such as pancake and hot chocolate mix.

The major source of dietary trans fat, found in PHVO, can be replaced with currently available heart healthy alternatives. Denmark has recently successfully removed artificial trans fat by limiting industrially produced trans fat content in food to 2% of total calories from fat. In addition, in June 2006 the Canadian Trans Fat Task Force issued a report recommending that Canada limit trans fat in food service establishments to 2% of total fat content in margarines and vegetable oils and 5% of total fat content in all other food ingredients.12 “Zero grams” trans fat packaged foods in the US, both new products and those already in production, have been extensively marketed since the labeling requirement for packaged foods became effective in January of 2006. Many manufacturers have reformulated a number of their existing products that are now widely available as “zero grams” trans fat (defined by the FDA as <0.5 grams per serving) on supermarket shelves. A recent New England Journal of Medicine article reports that industry and government representatives agreed that the restriction of trans fat in Denmark “did not appreciably affect the quality, cost or availability of food.”13 This experience demonstrates that artificial trans fat can be replaced without consumers noticing an effect.14 Acceptable healthier alternatives to PHVOs include traditional mono and poly unsaturated vegetable oils (e.g., canola, corn, olive, etc.) that have not been hydrogenated, as well as newly developed oils such as those made from specially cultivated varieties of soybeans, safflowers, and sunflowers. Further, many of the newer trans fat-free oils have long ‘fry lives’ and other favored characteristics of PHVOs. Educational and enforcement efforts will seek to promote a shift to healthier fats. In response to increased demand, US companies are expanding production of products that will increase the market supply of alternatives to hydrogenated oils.
