# Assessment_Da Wang, Feb. 10 2015_The main problem of the material is that its author stands in a wrong place. Being in such a position that is opposite to the customers is one of the best way to ruin a company. The writer must be good at it!Every writer has his style. As it is, we may not be able to find the best writing but the most suitable writing. I can analyze word by word, phase by phase, sentence by sentence to prove how unsuitable the writing is. But it is useless because that’s his track and it’s kind of boring to do the correction job.So let’s think more deeply.Writing is for reading. Writing is construction as well as reconstruction. Reading is reconstruction as well as construction. At the very beginning we have an idea, and we build a building for it. Then the reader see that building, in the meantime they destroy it and reconstruct it in his mind. Here is the procedure:What the writer thinks-> words that writer uses -> words that reader reads -> what the reader thinksIt’s difficult to make the writer and the reader think in the same way. Especially when they are on different sides. So what I do for the material is just help the writer stand back to the side where the customers are.I use ‘character-action’ method to make reader read and understand and conceal most of the boring facts that most people won’t care about.That’s my starting point, meanwhile the destination, of my revising process.
