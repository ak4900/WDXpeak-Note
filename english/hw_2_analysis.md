## Situation, Audience and Purpose

+ Situation: Because of the fact that trans fat is highly related to the risk of cardiovascular disease, the Board of Health and Mental Hygiene wants to announce a hearing of prohibiting the trans fat in restaurants.
+ Audience: The owner of FSEs and non-retail food processing establishments.
+ Purpose: Let them stop using trans fat in their products.

## Most Stylistic Problems and Principles

Cohesion and coherence is the key to the stylistic problems in this article.
Cohesion means connections between sentences and coherence means the management of topics so that multiple sentences develop one idea.

## Examples

Just use the the first paragragh as an example. Each sentence has a different character-action pair which make the reader jump from topic to topic. What makes things worse it that no connections are there. And the use of nominalization also makes the meaning vague and unclear.

When we come to the section 'Basis for restricting service of products containing artificial trans fat'. The problem becomes even worse. Firstly it mentions the heart disease topic and than jump to scientific evidence in the next sentence while we don't even know what's happening.

## Method

What I'm going to do is to rearrange the topics in the paragragh so that readers don't have to jump from one topic to another. To make things better, I'll also eliminate those nominalizations in order to make the points clearer.
One more thing, in my opinion the documents from big organizations always want to say too much things which makes the article too complex.
