## Module 3.1

+ What’s the Difference between Multicore and Manycore?
    * Multicore: yoke of oxen. Each core optimized for executing a single thread.
    * Manycore: flock of chickens. Cores optimized for aggregate throughput, deemphasizing individual performance.
+ When does using a GPU make sense?
    * Application with a lot of concurrency (1000-way, fine-grained concurrency)
    * Some memory intensive applications (Aggregate memory bandwidth is higher)
    * Advantage diminishes when task granularity becomes too large to fit in shared memory

## Module 3.2

+ What are the three ways to improve execution throughput?
    * Maximizing Memory Throughput
        - SoA vs AoS
        - Memory coalescing
        - Use of shared memory
        - Memory bank conflict
        - Padding
    * Maximizing Instruction Throughput
        - Branch divergence
        - Optimize instruction mix
    * Maximizing Scheduling Throughput
+ When to use SOA vs AOS?
    * Unfortunately, the SoA form is not ideal in all circumstances. For random or incoherent circumstances, gathers are used to access the data and the SoA form can result in extra unneeded data being read into cache, thus reducing performance. In this case, use of the AoS form instead will result in a smaller working set and improved performance. Generally, though, if the computation is to be vectorized, the SoA form is preferred.
+ What is memory coalescing? When to use it? Why is it important?
    * Memory coalescing: combine multiple memory accesses generated from multiple threads into a single physical transaction
    * Hardware Constraint: DRAM is accessed in 'segments' of 32B/64B/128B
+ What is shared memory? How to use it?
    * Manycore processors provide memory local to each core
    * `__share__`
+ What is memory bank conflict? How to work around it?
    * A bank conflict occurs if two or more threads access any bytes within different 32-bit words belonging to the same bank.
    * If each thread in a halfwarp accesses successive 32bit values there are no bank conflicts.
+ What is branch divergence?
    * threads of a warp diverge via a data-dependent conditional branch
