# Midterm Preparation

In Class 50 minutes, 100 points

Four Parts:

1. Short questions
2. OpenMP - code interpretation
3. CUDA - code interpretation
4. SIMD - code interpretation

## Short questions

+ Describe a general problem in which OpenMP can't be applied, and why.
+ Race conditions and false sharing are common problems in OpenMP code.
    * Write a small code snippet that demonstrates false sharing
    * Write a samll code snippet that demonstrates a race condition
+ I would like to improve the throughput of a CUDA kernel. What are the three areas I could look at to improve execution throughput? What tools could I use for measuring the performance?
