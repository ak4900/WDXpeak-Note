WDXpeak Note
===========

I'm planning to migrate all my note to github. I can not stand the evernote anymore -> huge, slow, ugly. I want an elegant way to note my life.

Evernote is a great tool to collect and connect to the word. But not a good tool to build links within. So It's time to change!

Here is how I arrange my personal notebook

+ *image*     : contains all the images used in the markdown
+ **computer**  : basic & important knowledge about computer science
+ **algorithm** : Prepare for interview
+ openmp    : Techniques for parallel computation
+ english   : notes for learning English
+ foundation of computer architecture : CMU 18640 course notes
+ python    : Need re-document
+ html5     : Need re-document
+ java      : Need re-document
+ objc      : Need re-document
+ py-opencv : Use opencv with python
