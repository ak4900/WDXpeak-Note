WDXpeak Note
===========

I'm planning to migrate all my note to github. I can not stand the evernote anymore -> huge, slow, ugly. I want an elegant way to note my life.

Evernote is a great tool to collect and connect to the word. But not a good tool to build links within. So It's time to change!

Iâ€˜ve merge my blog into this note.
