# Four Hour Body

Tim Ferris wrote an unconventional guide to lifestyle design with the Four Hour Workweek. In this
book, he'll show us the shortcuts to a fit and healthy life. The notes here cover rapid fat loss,
rapid strength gain, perfecting sleep, and life extension.

# Fundamentals

The **minimum effective dose (MED)** is the smallest dose that will produced a desired outcome.
Anything beyond the MED is wasteful.

To reach your desired outcome, you'll work in three areas: diet, drugs, and exercise. An equal split
would be ~33% in each. It's possible to use more of one area. 100% drugs means there will be side
effects. 100% exercise is too easy to derail. Ferris suggests 60% diet, 10% drugs, 30% exercise.

Recreation is for fun. Exercise is for producing changes. Ferris warns us not to confuse the two.

Embrace the yo-yo diet. As long as your timing is right, it's okay to sneak in cheats. As long as it
means you'll adhere to the stricter portion of your diet.

Have a measurable goal. "I want to be healthy" is not actionable. Think "I want to lose 5% of my
body fat".

In body redesign, our destination should be a better ratio of body composition instead of just
weight. Make sure you keep track of your body fat percentage.

# Ground Zero

People suck at following advice to become fit:

1. The pain isn't enough to facilitate a change in lifestyle
2. No consistent tracking == no awareness

Chad Fowler had his "Harajuku moment" in Harajuku while shopping for clothes. That's when he
realized he wanted a more fit lifestyle. He had a successful career by being aggressive and not
going with the flow, why not do the same with health?

Ferris highlights the importance of tracking. Fowler didn't follow the advice from this book, but he
did keep track of calories and exercising.

# Slow Carb Diet Basics

The Slow Carb Diet is better fat loss through simplicity. There are 5 rules:

1. Avoid carbs that are or can be white. This includes: all bread, rice, cereal, potatoes, pasta,
   tortilla, and fried food with breading.
2. Eat the same meals over and over again. Successful dieters do this. Mix and match from each
   group: protein, legumes, and vegetables.
3. Don't drink calories. Just water, unsweetened tea, coffee, or red wine.
4. Don't eat fruit. Only exceptions are tomatoes and avocadoes.
5. Take one day off per week.

My favorite parts about this diet is that it's simple to cook and cheap.

# Slow Carb Diet Finer Points and FAQs

### Should I take any supplements?
Ferris recommends potassium, magnesium, and calcium. You might lose excess water along with
electrolytes. Potassium can be obtained through potassium enriched salts or avocadoes. Calcium via
tofu or tempeh. Magnesium via almonds, spinach, or soybeans.

### Does cheat day undo all of my progress?
No. Expect massive fluctuations after cheat day and relax. It'll disappear within the next 48 hours.

### Can I use spices, salts, or sauces?
Spices and herbs are your friends, but no cream based sauces. Butter is fine as long as the only
ingredient is butter and salt.

### What should I eat for snacks?
You shouldn't. If you're hungry, eat more protein and legumes during your meals. If you're eating
enough - it's a psychological addiction you should get over.

### Do I have to binge once a week?
It's important to spike caloric intake once a week. Everyone binges eventually, it's better to do it
at an interval than randomly.

### Can I eat whole grains or steel-cut oats?
No.

### Can I eat fried foods?
Yes, it's encouraged. Just avoid deep fried foods.

### What if I'm traveling and don't have access to my diet foods?
Grab a bag of almonds or raw nuts. It's better to choose mild hunger than to deviate from your diet.

### Common mistakes are:

1. Skipping breakfast. It's closely associated with over eating in the evening. Eat a protein rich
   breakfast within one hour of waking up, or you will fail.
2. Not eating enough protein or legumes. You don't want your metabolism to drop.
3. Not drinking enough water, especially on cheat days.
4. Believing that you'll cook.
5. Over-eating "domino" foods like nuts, chickpeas, or peanuts.
6. Overconsuming artificial sweeteners.
7. Hitting the gym too often and rewarding yourself.

# Binge Damage Control

The three principles are:

1. Minimize the release of insulin
2. Increase the speed of gastric emptying
3. Engage in brief muscular contraction throughout the binge

Insulin release is minimized by blunting sharp jumps in blood sugar. This can be done by:

1. Ensure the first meal is not a binge meal, but a smallish one that's high in fiber and protein.
2. Consume a small quantity of fructose fruit sugar (grapefruit juice) before the first binge meal.
   You can do this during breakfast also.
3. Use supplements that increase insulin sensitivity (AGG or PAGG).
4. Consume citric juices like lime juice in water or lemon juice on food.

Increasing the speed of gastric emptying can be done with caffeine or tea. Green tea works well. So
does dark chocolate.

Ferris recommends air squats, wall presses, and chest pulls with an elastic band. Do these about
60-90 minutes before and after you eat. Do these exercises for 60-120 seconds. It brings GLUT-4 to
the surface of muscle cells instead of fat cells for calories to flow into.

# Building Posterior

The posterior chain includes all muscles from the base of your skull down to your Achilles tendons.
The secret is Russian kettlebell swinging twice a week for an average of 15-20 minutes each.

Here are the guidelines:

1. Stand with your feet 6 to 12 inches outside of shoulder width on either side, each foot pointed
   outward about 30 degrees. If toes pointed straight ahead were 12:00 on a clock face, your left
   foot would point at 10:00 or 11:00, and your right would point at 1:00 or 2:00.
2. Keep your shoulders pulled back and down to avoid rounding your back.
3. The lowering backswing movement is sitting-back-on-a-chair movement not a squatting-down
   movement.
4. Do not let your shoulders go in front of your knees at any point.
5. Imagine pinching a penny between your butt cheeks when you pop your hips forward. This should be
   a forceful pop and it should be impossible to contract your butt further.

You can take it further by adding two other routines. Every Mon, Wed, and Fri prior to breakfast you
can:

1. Do one set of 20 two-legged glute activation raises
2. Do one set of 15 flying dogs on each side
3. Do one set of 50 kettlebell swings

# Six Minute Abs

The prerequisite for visible abs is to follow a diet that allows a sustained 12% body fat or less.

There are two exercises which work well: the Myotatic Crunch and the Cat Vomit.

To do the Myotatic Crunch:

1. Sit with your back on BOSU, Swiss ball, or pile of firm cushions. Ensure your butt is close to
   the floor.
2. Stretch your arms overhead as high as possible, keep them behind or next to your ears for the
   entire exercise.
3. Lower under control for 4 seconds until your fingers touch the floor, the entire time attempting
   to extend your hands further away from the ball.
4. Pause at the bottom for 2 seconds, aiming for maximum elongation.
5. Rise under control and pause in the upper, fully contracted position for 2 seconds. The arms
   should not pass perpendicular with the ground.
6. Repeat for 10 reps. Once you can do so, add weights.

It turns out laughing works out your abs very well. To do the Cat Vomit:

1. Get on all fours and keep your gaze focused either directly under your head or slightly in front
   of you. Don't arch your back or strain your neck.
2. Forcefully exhale from your mouth until ALL air is fully expelled.
3. Hold your breath and pull your belly button upward toward your spine as hard as you can for a
   target of 8 to 12 seconds.
4. Inhale fully through the nose after the 8 to 12 seconds.
5. Take one breath cycle of rest then repeat for 10 reps.

# Injury Proofing

The most likely cause of injury isn't weakness or tightness, it's imbalance. The core works fine as
long as the hips aren't moving. Once they're moving, the core starts trying to compensate and
balance.

Gary Cook came up with a Functional Movement Screening to determine if you have an imbalance or not.
He does this through a pass/fail evaluation of:

* Deep squat
* Hurdle step
* In-line lunge
* Active straight leg raise
* Seated rotation

If you do have the imbalance, the core four protective exercises to fix it are:

* Chop and lift
* Turkish get up
* Two-arm single-leg deadlift
* Cross-body one-arm single-leg deadlift

# Effortless Superhuman

Strength is a skill - that can be learned quickly. The workouts are:

1. Dynamic stretching before each session with "over-unders" see
   http://www.fourhourbody.com/over-under
2. One of the following with 5 minutes rest between sets: a. Bench Press 2-3 sets of 2-3 reps or b.
   Push Ups 10-12 reps
3. Conventional deadlift to knees, 2-3 sets of 2-3 reps and then dropped to the ground to avoid
   injury. Total lift time for each set should be 10 seconds. Perform Plyometrics after each set and
   then a 5 minute rest before next rep.
4. Core exercise, 3-5 sets of 3-5 reps isometric holds or torture twist. Sit on a bench, lock your
   feet below a pole or another bench, then turn to each side and hold for 3 seconds on each.
5. Static stretching

# Perfecting Sleep

Ferris used multiple devices to keep track of his sleep like WakeMate, Zeo, and FitBit. Using these,
he found that:

1. Good sleep (8-10) was dependent on the ratio of REM to total sleep instead of total REM duration
2. Increase REM percentage by extending total sleep time past nine hours or intentionally waking up
   approximately four and a half hours after sleep onset for 5-10 minutes before going back to sleep
3. Taking 200 milligrams of huperizine-A 30 minutes before going to bed. As always, speak to your
   doctor before using. It's not a recommended long term solution
4. The higher percentage of deep wave sleep, the better physical performance
5. Too much wine within four hours of sleep will decrease deep wave sleep
6. Eating two tablespoons of organic almond butter on celery sticks before bed eliminated
   "feel-like-shit" mornings. Two tablespoons of flaxseed oil will add to this effect

Some other sleeping tips:

* Experiment with different room temperatures to fall asleep faster. Most people prefer 67F to 70F
  degrees. Usually a colder temperature helps you fall asleep.
* Eating a large fat and protein dominated meal within hours of bedtime will also help you fall
  asleep faster.
* To most useful sleep tool is the goLITE which uses light cues to put you to sleep.
* Exercise
* Take a cold bath one hour prior to bed
* Use a humidifier
* Resort to the self-imposed half military crawl position which forces you to stay still and fall
  asleep

# Living Forever

The hard part about extending your lifetime is how to do it without living a complete boring life.

Cycles of 5-10 grams of creatine monohydrate reduces risks of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and
Huntington's diseases. It has side effects though. Consult a doctor before taking.

Scientists have discovered that a lower caloric intake is highly correlated with a longer lifetime.
Do this with intermittent fasting or protein cycling. The Fast-5 diet is fasting for 19 hours
starting at when you go to sleep. Then eat at anytime during 5 hours before going to sleep.

The Alternate Day Caloric Restriction diet requires that calories are cut 50 to 80% every other day.
Protein cycling refers to having up/down cycles of normal protein intake and half the recommended.

Bloodletting reduces the risk of heart attacks and other diseases by letting out the extra iron in
our system. Once every 8 weeks is recommended. For males only.
