# Article Marketing Made Simple

This is a short book by Michael H. Fleischner about how to use article marketing to rank higher in
search engines.

# Why Article Marketing and Getting Started

Article marketing is just writing articles for websites other than your own. The two benefits of
this are:

1. increase your readership and authority on a subject
2. get a backlink back to your own website

The second benefit means your own website will start ranking higher in search engine results.

To get started with article marketing:

1. research possible sites or blogs to submit your article to
2. write keyword optimized articles about your niche
3. send content to the partner site, directories, or forums
4. wait and let the search engines start indexing your articles

Articles should be **400 - 650 words** in length. Less than 400 means the article isn't substantial
enough. In fact, many directories won't let you submit anything under 400 words. Over 650 words
means your time could be better spent writing more articles. It's a delicate balance between quality
and quantity.

# The Resource Box

The resource box is a section where you usually put "About The Author" content. This is where you
get to link back to your website. This section is important and is the pay-off you get for writing
unique content for other websites.

Here's an example:

> Are you looking for guidance on how to pay for your college loans?
> Go to the (Student Loan Consolidation)[http://studentloanconsolidationbasics.blogspot.com/]
> Blog for a FREE report on paying for college. In addition, you can find
> helpful information on choosing an online school.

When you link back to your website, be sure put thought into the keywords for the anchor text. This
is how search engines determine which sites show up for which search queries.

# Writing the Article

Some tips Fleischner recommends for writing:

* keep a diary or journal
* relax and take time to sort things out
* create a work space to inspire creativity
* get away

Make sure you use **targeted keywords and keyword phrases** sometimes called LSI for latent semantic
index. Have a 2 to 4 percent keyword density. So for a 400 word article, make sure 8 to 16 words are
your keywords.

Some other options are outsourcing article writing or using public domain articles.

Fleischner recommends:

* using short paragraphs
* make use of numbers or bullets
* use sub-headings
* use good attention grabbing titles or headers
* keep them interested start to finish
* utilize figures when appropriate

# Affiliate Marketing

Affiliate marketing is just like a sales commission. You get a special URL that you link to. When
people click on it and purchase something, you get a percentage of the sale. The link can be from
the article (if the directory allows it) or from your own website. Use article marketing as a way to
get traffic to your own website.

The steps are:

1. find untapped niche market
2. research low competition keyword phrase
3. find product that fits keywords
4. write minimum of 10 articles based on keywords
5. submit articles to directories
6. collect commissions

# Submitting and Promoting Articles

Some directories that Fleischner recommends are:

* <http://www.ezinearticles.com>
* <http://www.goarticles.com>
* <http://www.searchwarp.com>
* <http://www.articlesbase.com>
* <http://www.buzzle.com>
* <http://www.articlealley.com>
* <http://www.webpronews.com>

There are meta tools which will submit your site to thousands of article directories on your behalf.
Be careful though, if a search engine discovers that your site acquired thousands of back links in
less than a day your website may get banned. Here are the tools:
