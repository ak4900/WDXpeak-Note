A reference guide by Leo Babauta on leading a simple life.

# What Is A Minimalist Life & How To Become A Minimalist

**Figure out what makes you happy - get rid of the rest, make room for important.**

Some common goals:

* have more freedom and time
* have more room for what's important
* have less worry
* be more frugal
* be healthier

The principles to achieve these goals are are:

1. Omit needless things
2. Identify the essential
3. Make everything count
4. Fill your life with joy
5. Always be editing

The steps to take to reach these goals are:

1. Realize you already have enough
2. Start cutting back on clutter and possessions
3. Start simplifying your schedule
4. Slowly edit everything you do with principles in mind

# Contentedness & Simplifying What You Do

It's not enough to strip clutter - it will come back unless you're content. You must realize that
**you already have enough**: food, water, basic clothing, shelter, and loved ones. That's all you
really need. Stop buying the non necessities. Learn to be happy by doing instead of owning. Be
content.

Everyone has their own limit to what's a non-necessity. Examples of what you can might be able to
get rid of:

* cars - can you share one car, use public transportation, bike, or walk?
* meat - can you be a vegetarian, vegan, weekday vegetarian/vegan?
* excessive clothes - can you make do with a basic wardrobe?
* big house - less stuff means less house

It's not just about what you own, **it's also about what you do**. Get rid of commitments you don't
enjoy. Only do what's necessary and what you do enjoy.

Reduce your commitments by:

1. List out all of your commitments
2. Pick the most important ones
3. Slowly remove the ones that didn't make the cut
4. If a new one pops up, only say yes if it's a "Hell Yes!" - otherwise say no

# Clearing Clutter: Home & Workspace

Stuff weighs you down, stresses you out, is expensive (to buy, store, maintain), and creates
clutter. Clutter is poison. Some simple rules to remove clutter:

1. If you haven't used in in 6-12 months, toss it.
2. Don't hold on to things, consider renting it instead.
3. Take a picture for memories.
4. If you can't throw it away, create a maybe box. If it stays in the box for a year, throw it out.

Leo recommends getting started with one area at a time. Don't try to tackle the entire house at
once.

Tips for your workspace:

* have one inbox
* clear out the inbox every day
* clear your desk
* get rid of knick-knacks
* clear your computer desktop
* consider going paperless
* eliminate unnecessary tools
* simplify filing

# Minimalist Travel, Wardrobe, Grooming

The minimalist travels with a light bag, itinerary, and attitude. Pack as lightly as possible and
keep your itinerary loose. Can you make do with just a carry-on bag?

Leo's travel bag:

* travel docs (passport, credit card, ID)
* toiletries (deodorant, toothbrush)
* 2 pairs of shorts/jeans
* 2 tshirts
* 2 pairs underwear
* swim trunks or hoodie
* 1 book
* journal/pen
* camera, charger

You can buy what you need at the destination. You can wash your clothes at night in the sink or
shower. This is all packed in a light backpack. Use high tech fabrics, which dry over night and lets
you wash them in the sink.

Don't over-plan the trip, keep some free time available. Arrive early, take naps, enjoy the
locals/food/sights.

You can minimize your wardrobe by choosing clothes with solid colors. Solid colors go with
everything. Also use high quality clothes that don't fall apart after a few washes. Get rid of
clothes you haven't worn in the past 6 months.

For grooming Leo just uses soap, toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, shaving cream, and deodorant.

# Minimalist Food, Fitness, Finances

**Eat less.** Eat food in as natural a state as possible. Prepare simply so you don't have to spend
all day in the kitchen.

How to eat less:

1. Eat until you're almost full instead of reaching 100% full.
2. Eat smaller and lighter meals.
3. Eat fiber-rich and water-rich foods like fruits, veggies, and beans.
4. Avoid restaurants that serve huge amounts or split the meals.
5. Fast for 18-24 hours a couple times a week.

Leo advocates eating food closest to its natural state. Raw food is good, but it doesn't necessarily
have to be raw. Some suggestions are fruits, veggies, nuts, legumes, natural nut butters, nut oils,
whole grains, and lean proteins. Shoot for 90% of the time.

**Cook for yourself to save money and be healthier!** Some simple recipes:

* dress up an Amy's Kitchen frozen pizza with veggies
* rolled oats with berries, nuts, fruits, flaxseed, cinnamon, etc...
* veggie chilli
* black bean tacos with lettuce, tomatoes, corn, salsa
* yogurt, fruit, berries, and nuts
* whole grain pita, hummus, olives, tomatoes, spinach
* whole grain pasta with veggies

Note to self: check out the longevity diet (restricted caloric intake) and fast 5 diet.

Minimalist fitness focuses on working out less with less equipment. Start out with walking if you've
been inactive. Slowly upgrade to a walk-run or jog-run. The key is to get active. Use your
bodyweight instead of gym equipment:

* pull-ups
* push-ups
* jump squats
* bicycle crunches
* jumping lunges
* burpees
* hanging knee raises
* diamond push-ups
* planks
* chin-ups

You can also mix in some biking, dumbbells, bar bells, kettlebells, jump rope, martial arts, or
crossfit.

Minimalist finances means:

1. End consumerism
2. Save up an emergency fund
3. Get out of debt
4. Use cash instead of credit
5. Automate finances (savings, bill paying)
6. Don't buy unless you need it and have the money

# Dealing With Non-Minimalist Loved Ones

Some tips from Leo:

1. Focus on yourself where you can
2. Lead by example and show how wonderful it can be
3. Educate and talk with them
4. Ask for help
5. Set boundaries, don't ask people to change
6. Find compromises
7. Find acceptance

# Minimalism Is The End Of Organizing And The Start Of Sustainability

When you have less stuff, you don't have to organize. Closets without too much clothes don't need to
be organized. Tasks don't need a complicated system if you've a few commitments. The need to
organize fades away.

When you live a life of less, you'll walk lightly on the earth. Less consumption, fewer natural
resources, less pollution all has the side effect of a greener life. A few examples of what you'll
do to help:

1. Buy less stuff
2. Eat less
3. Eat less meat
4. Use less packaging
5. Drive less
6. Have a smaller house
