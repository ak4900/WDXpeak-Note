# You Are Your Own Gym

A bodyweight fitness book by Mark Lauren with Joshua Clark. These notes cover the high level, for
refer to the book for specific exercises and program details.

# Why Bodyweight Exercises?

Bodyweight exercises have many pros:

* minimal requirements (use your body for resistance)
* targets multiple muscles
* motions that prevent joint injuries
* flexible difficulty (eg. push ups on knees, on feet, feet on table, or vertical)

# Why Strength Training?

Strength training should be the core of your condition. Cardio is inefficient/ineffective. It
causes muscle wasting because your body adapts. Aerobic training should only be used to develop
movement proficiency (eg. preparing for a 5k run or triathlon).

Interval strength training means repeated performance of high intensity exercises followed by set
periods of rest. During high intensity exercise, your body oxidizes carbs for energy instead of fat.
Other pros include strengthened tendons/ligaments, increased bone density, repairing muscle tissues,
building new muscles, and long lasting increased metabolism.

Any effect you week from aerobic activity can be achieved more efficiently with high intensity
strength training.

# So What Is "Fitness" Anyway?

Fitness across a diverse set of muscles look more attractive (eg. sprinter looks better than
powerlifter, ballet dancer looks better than marathoner). Diversity of muscle spectrum matters.
Bulky bodybuilders look like they lack endurance, marathoners look like they lack strength.

Lauren's program hits entire spectrum:

* Muscular Strength: exert a force through a given distance, eg classic vs vertical push up
* Muscular Endurance: how long can you exert a force, eg how long can you maintain a pull up
* Cardiovascular Endurance: body's ability to supply oxygen during activity
* Power: exert a force in amount of time, eg 1x pull up per minute vs 50x pull ups per minute
* Speed: body's ability to rapidly perform motions
* Coordination: ability to combine multiple movements to create single distinct movement
* Balance: ability to maintain center of gravity
* Flexibility: your range of motion

Focus on increasing your ability for each of these skill. By improving your ability, your appearance
will also improve. Form follows function.

# Nutrition

Stick to the fundamentals of healthy eating:

* balancing quality protein, carbohydrates, fats
* only adjust your calorie intake to meet goals (keep balance the same)
* develop healthy eating habits

The macronutrients play vital roles to your health:

* carbohydrates: fruit, veggies, pasta, grains, sugars, cereals, and rice. Can be simple or complex.
  Eat carbs with low glycemic index (fruit, vegetables are best, next is dairy or whole grain)
* fats: saturated (from hydrogenated oils) or unsaturated (nuts, seeds, soy, olives, olive oil, fish).
  Should take up 25-35% of our caloric intake and should eat mostly unsaturated fats (nuts and seeds).
* protein: essential for muscle and include poultry, meat, fish, dairy, soy, tofu, beans, eggs.
* water isn't a macronutrient, but it's often ignored. Drink more!

The Resting Metabolic Rate is the amount of calories needed to sustain all body functions while at
rest. Building muscle will increase your body's natural tendency to burn calories at rest. So
the formula is:

1. build calorie burning muscle via strength training
2. create a modest calorie deficit through dietary restraint

Lauren recommends losing weight at a slow pace, 0.5-1.5 pounds per week. Losing at a fast pace either
through diet or aerobics will also burn muscle, meaning it'll just come back after a bit of time.

The recommended diet is eating 250-750 caloric deficit daily with 1.5 grams protein per pound of
ideal bodyweight (split remaining calories between unsaturated fats and low glycemic index carbs).

# Common Strength Training Myths

* Spot Reduction: fat loss can't be isolated to a specific area.
* Muscle Can Turn Into Fat: they are different cells.
* You Muscle Will Get Too Big With Strength Training: it won't happen accidentally.
* More Is Better: over-training and poor nutrition are common pitfalls. Watch out for halt in
  progress, chronic fatigue, decreased motivation, and injures.
* You Can Reshape a Muscle By Doing Isolation Exercises: this is determined by genetics. You can only
  grow or shrink specific muscles.
* High Reps For Definition and Low Reps For Mass: only determined by size of muscle and fat around.
* Strength Training Makes You Big, Cardio Makes You Lean: muscle is the best fat burning tool in
  your arsenal.

# Intensity

Workouts may be short but they must be intense.

Every exercise has variations to decrease/increase the difficulty. Always look to increase. A common
approach after taking a set to near failure:

* switch to easier variation
* prolong last negative movement (eg during push ups, try lowering to ground as slow as possible)
* do more reps with 3-5 second negatives
* hold fully extended/contracted position as long as you can
* intentionally pause for 3-5 seconds at most difficult part
* after muscle failure, do a few more half reps
* combine any of the above techniques

# Training Tools

* repetition: single complete movement, so 9 push ups translates to 9 reps
* set: complete series of reps from beginning to end, 3x12 means 3 sets of 12 reps
* reaching failure: means do as many repetitions until not humanly possible
* ladders: 1x rep, rest, 2x reps, rest, 3x reps, ... until failure. Rest time should equal amount of
  time per set (so first rest is much shorter than last rest)
* push-pull ladder: alternate between push/pull sets without rests
* stappers: choose any number of exercises/reps and repeat as much as possible in 20 minutes
* supersets: sets without rests in between
* interval sets: usually 1, 2, 3-minute intervals. Start exercise until failure, then rest until
  interval is done
* easy gleason: 1 pull up first minute, 2x pull ups second minute, ...
* timed sets: do as many reps as possible in given time
* timed workout: do any workout as quickly as possible regardless of how many sets it takes
* tabatas: 20 seconds exercise + 10 seconds rest, for 8 rounds totalling 4 minutes; this is ideal
  for workouts in short period of time (eg 3x tabatas = 15 minutes workout with short rests)
* 52 pick up: shuffle cards, ace-4 are push exercises, 5-7 are pull, 8-10 core, face cards are legs.
  Go through deck and do a set for each card without as little rest periods as possible.
* circuit training: series of exercises with short rest intervals between sets, work all major muscle
  groups and perform at least 2 sets per group
* active recovery: back-to-back exercises with low/moderate intensity and little/no rest to maintain
  heart range for 20-60 minutes
* pyramids: work up to very high intensity variations of an exercise, eg 10 push ups at your
  ability level, then 8 with 2 second pause, then 6 with 4 second pause, etc...
* compound sets: 3 or more compound exercises one after the other without rest

You can break you muscle groups into:

* shoulders
* triceps
* chest
* lats
* biceps and forearms
* core
* thighs
* calves

Lauren likes to work at high intensity on a sole muscle group per day. You can also target two
muscle groups and only work out 4 days per week.

Be creative by combining the training tools with targeted muscle groups to create variation.

# The Program

All plans follow the same program: exercise 4-5 times/week for 20-30 minutes on 10 week cycles.
Move from each plan after 10 weeks: Beginner -> 1st Class -> Master -> Chief.

All programs consists of blocks which utilize different workout types:

* Muscular Endurance (weeks 1-2): uses Ladders to promote movement proficiency
* Strength Training (weeks 3-4): less reps but turning up the intensity
* Power Block (weeks 5-6): higher intensity 
* Undulating Block (weeks 6-10): employs all methods

Each program starts with high volume, low intensity to learn but slowly changes to become low volume,
high intensity.
