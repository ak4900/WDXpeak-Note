# Food Rules

Michael Pollan's "Eater's Manual" can be summarized in three rules: eat food, not too much, mostly
plants. But here are a few more good guidelines to follow.

# Part 1: What Should I Eat?

* Eat food (real foods that aren't highly processed)
* Don't eat anything your great grandmother wouldn't recognize
* Avoid food containing ingredients no human would keep in the pantry
* Avoid food with high fructose corn syrup
* Avoid food that have sugar/sweetener listed among top three ingredients
* Avoid food that has more than 5 ingredients
* Avoid food with hard to pronounce ingredients
* Avoid food with health claims
* Avoid food worded as "lite" or "low fat" or "non fat"
* Avoid imitation food (aka margarine)
* Avoid food advertised on TV
* Shop the peripheries of the supermarket, stay out of the middle
* Eat only foods that will eventually rot
* Eat foods made from ingredients you can picture in their raw state or grows in nature
* Buy meals at the farmers' market
* Buy snacks at the farmers' market
* Eat foods that have been cooked by humans (rather than corporations)
* Don't ingest foods made in places where everyone is required to wear a surgical cap
* If it came from a plant, eat it; if it was made in a plant, don't
* It's not food if it arrived through the window of your car
* It's not food if it's called by the same name in every language

# Part 2: What Kind Of Food Should I Eat?

* Eat mostly plants, especially leaves
* Treat meat as a flavoring or special occasion food
* Eating what stands on one leg (plants) is better than what stands on two legs (fowl) is better
  than what stands on four legs (cows, pigs, ...)
* Eat a variety of colors
* Drink the water in which vegetables are cooked (save it for soup or add it to sauces)
* Eat animals that have themselves eaten well
* If you have space, buy a freezer
* Eat like an omnivore (eat a diversity of plant species)
* Eat well grown food from healthy soil
* Eat wild foods when you can (weeds, wild animals)
* Don't overlook the oily little fishes
* Eat some food that have been fermented by bacteria or fungi (yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut, soy sauce)
* Sweeten and salt your food yourself
* Eat sweet foods as you find them in nature
* Don't eat breakfast cereals that change the color of your milk
* The whiter the bread, the sooner you'll be dead
* Favor oils/grains that have traditionally been stone-ground
* Eat as much junk food as you want as long as you cook it yourself
* Care about your health (be the kind of person who takes supplements but skip the supplements)
* Eat more like the French, or Japanese, or Italians, or Greeks (pick a traditional diet and follow)
* Regard nontraditional foods with skepticism
* Have a glass of wine with dinner

# Part 3: How Should I Eat?

* Eat less (consider calorie restriction)
* Pay more, eat less (go for quality instead of quantity)
* Stop eating before you're full. Instead of asking if you're full, ask if your hunger is gone
* Eat when you're hungry and not when you're bored
* Consult your gut (your eyes are bigger than your stomach)
* Eat slowly
* Savor your first few bites of your meal
* Spend as much time eating the meal as you took to prepare it
* Buy smaller plates/glasses
* Serve a proper portion and don't go back for seconds
* Breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, dinner like a pauper
* Eat meals instead of snacks
* Limit snacks to unprocessed plant foods
* Don't get fuel from same place your car does (don't eat at gas stations)
* Do all your eating at the dinner table (single task on eating, don't eat while doing something else)
* Try not to eat alone
* Treat treats as treats
* Leave something on your plate
* Plant a vegetable garden
* Cook
* Break the rules once in a while
