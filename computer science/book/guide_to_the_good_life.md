# A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy

By William B Irvine, this book is an introduction to Stoic philosophy. It's a practical philosophy
to apply to your lifestyle. Having a framework to make decisions and act helps prevent you from
living a bad life.

# Philosophy Takes an Interest in Life

Irvine walks us through the history of philosophy, which became popular sometime in the 6th century
BC:

* Pythagoras 570-500 BC in Italy
* Thales 636-546 BC in Greece
* Confucius 551-479 BC in China
* Buddha 563-483 BC in India

It's not clear if each individual worked on their philosophy independently or if one influenced
another. We can track down how Stoicism came to be:

    Pythagoras -> ... -> Anaximander (Ionian branch) -> ... -> Socrates

Socrates (469-399 BC) was important because he changed the focus of Western philosophy from external
to internal. Philosophers before him concentrated on explaining the natural world around them - what
we call science now. After his death, his students started schools. Plato started the Academy which
focused on theory and Antisthenes founded the Cynic school to focus on lifestyle. The theoretical
side has flourished and is now taught in universities. The practical side teaching lifestyle has
withered away. Stoicism is emphasizes the practical/lifestyle side of philosophy.

Zeno started out with the Cynic school. Cynics lived an ascetic lifestyle - they only owned the
clothes they were wearing, were homeless, and learned to want next to nothing. Cyrenaics thought the
goal of living was to enjoy every pleasure and take advantage of every way to experience it.
Stoicism ended up falling in between both ideals.

# The First Stoics

Zeno was first a student of the Cynics. They pointed out how a statue, whose only function is to
please the eye, could cost thousands - while flour, whose function is to keep us alive, can be
bought for a few coins. They lived an ascetic lifestyle to be prepared for every fortune and enjoy
the basic necessities of life. Zeno eventually abandoned that school to learn more about theory. He
studied at the Megarian school for a bit, then at the Academy, then started his own school giving
lectures at Stoa Poikile (hence the name Stoic).

Like most schools, Stoicism was originally split into three parts: ethics, physics, and logic.
Ethics was the most important - not moral ethics but whether or not a person is living a good/happy
life. The Greeks equate having a good life with **attaining virtue**.

To be virtuous is to live as we were designed to live. Zeno asserted that humans were designed to be
reasonable and to perform our social duty.

> The goal of a Stoic is to be virtuous or to be reasonable and perform your
> social duty.

# Roman Stoicism

Whereas original Stoicism made its goal to attain virtue, the Romans changed it to be attaining
tranquility. They advocate the absence of negative emotions like grief, anger, anxiety and they
prefer positive emotions like joy. For the Romans, attaining virtue is the same as attaining
tranquility.

The most important Stoics were Roman: Seneca, Musonius Rufus, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius. They
spread Stoicism through their writings or teaching (for some of them it wasn't their intention).
Many of these philosophers had to live through being exiled.

Musonius said:

> We should study philosophy, since how otherwise could we hope to live well?

# Negative Visualization: What's the Worst That Can Happen?

Don't fall into the trap of hedonistic adaptation where once a person gets what they aim for, they
start having grander wants. This happens to lottery winners.

Stoics recommend we imagine losing the things we value - wife left, car stolen, or job lost. This
technique is called **negative visualization**. We start living more in the moment and appreciate
what we have. Change from wanting more to wanting what you already have.

Another related technique is **projective visualization**, if something bad happened imagine it
happened to someone else. It will dissipate your anger and show you how insignificant the bad
incident really was.

Seneca reminds us the impermanence of the world:

> All things human are short-lived and perishable.

# The Dichotomoy of Control: On Becoming Invincible

Change your goals so they align with what's easily obtainable. Change your wants so that it's
certainly obtainable.

Epictetus's **dichotomy of control** was:

> Some things are up to us and some are not up to us

Irvine updates this to be a more realistic **trichotomy of control**:

1. things we have no control over
2. things we have some control over
3. things we have complete control over

Stoics shouldn't worry over the first category of things. Don't expend any grief, stress, or energy.
Instead, focus on the second and third categories.

If we internalize goals, they go from the first category to the last. Instead of "winning the tennis
match", change your goal to be "becoming a better tennis player". Instead of "getting a promotion",
change your goal to be "becoming a better employee".

# Fatalism: Letting Go of the Past and Present

The Stoics believed in fate. Irvine argues that they were fatalistic with respect to the past. Your
actions have no effect on the past, so don't spend any time/energy on it. The past falls into the
category for which things you have no control.

Irvine also argues that the Stoics were fatalistic with respect to the present. That is, we cannot
change what's happening at this very moment in time. You can spend this moment thinking about how it
can be different or you can embrace it. This echoes Buddhism's advice to live in the moment.

This doesn't mean you're stuck with what you have. Stoics believe that you should do your best to
perform your social duty. If you do that well, external circumstances may improve. Don't seek
fortune and fame, but feel free to enjoy if it comes along as long as you don't get attached to it.

# Self-Denial: On Dealing with the Dark Side of Pleasure

Besides negative visualization, you can actually inflict negative things onto yourself (or deny
pleasures). Seneca recommends we practice poverty.

Skip a meal or fast to appreciate food more. Sleep on the floor for a night to appreciate your bed.
Doing this also has the side effect of lessening your fear of losing things. A stranger to
discomforts will view them as major negatives. If you've already experienced it, they'll just be
minor discomforts.

Stoics advise us to:

> Periodically engage in acts of voluntary discomfort and forgo opportunities
> to experience pleasure.

# Meditation: Watching Ourselves Practice Stoicism

We should periodically meditate on:

* events in our daily lives
* how did you respond to those events?
* how you should have responded?

Irvine recommends us going through a checklist at bedtime:

* are you practicing those psychological techniques?
* are you performing negative visualization?
* are you distinguishing between the trichotomy of controls?
* are you internalizing goals?
* are you concentrating on the future instead of the past/present?
* are you practicing self-denial of pleasures?

You can measure your signs of progress as a Stoic:

* are your feelings still hurt often from others?
* are you blaming, censoring, or praising others still?
* are you boasting still?
* are you blaming external events still?
* are you experiencing negative emotions still?

# Duty: On Loving Mankind

According to Marcus the emperor:

> I am bound to do good to my fellow creatures and bear with them.
> ...
> I should do so quietly and efficiently.

Instead of lazily lying in bed, you should get up every morning to do your work. Don't expect
thanks, admiration, or sympathy for doing your work any more than a racehorse expects thanks for
running a race. Stoics believe you should perform your social duty to earn tranquility.

# Social Relations: On Dealing with Other People

Seek friends who share your value and who are doing a better job at it than you. Vices are
contagious, don't put up with people who constantly upset you.

If you find someone annoying, keep in mind that you must also annoy other people. This will teach
you to be more patient.

# Insults: On Putting Up with Put-Downs

Insults create anger, a negative emotion that upsets tranquility. The Stoics created some techniques
to deal with insults:

* consider whether the insult is valid criticism
* consider if it's just due to misinformation
* if you don't respect the source of the insult, why bother getting upset over it? Stoics will
  become increasingly immune to other people's opinions of them
* respond with self-deprecating humor to take the sting away
* just ignore it

# Grief: On Vanquishing Tears with Reason

Seneca wrote:

> Never will I demand of you that you should not grieve at all.

For proper grieving, Polybius wrote:

> let your tears flow, but let them also cease, let deepest sighs be drawn from
> your breast, but let them also find an end

The primary technique used to prevent grief is negative visualization. It can be preemptive
(appreciate relationships more) or a minimizing tool (be thankful for the time spent in
relationships).

You can also reason grief away. For example, a death of a relative would cause grief. But the
relative would want us to stop crying eventually.

# Anger: On Overcoming Anti-Joy

Seneca calls anger a "brief insanity" and a waste of precious time:

> No plague has cost the human race more.

Sometimes it's okay to feign anger, for example as a way to punish/teach children to behave
properly. But you should never experience it inwardly.

Some advice for dealing with anger:

* don't jump to conclusions
* harden ourselves (don't coddle ourselves) so we're less likely to be angered by trivial matters
* keep in mind things that anger us don't really harm us, but being angry could cause more harmful
  effects
* keep in mind that many things aren't important in the grand scheme
* apologize for any outbursts and admit your mistakes

# Personal Values: On Seeking Fame

Don't mistakenly pursue local or world fame. Don't seek popularity, recognition, or admiration. The
price of fame is too high (it's difficult to get, it's out of our control, and it will upset us if
it cannot be obtained).

Epictetus says we'll be better off to be indifferent to social status. Stoics value freedom. Seeking
social status will give people power over our freedom.

Don't seek immortal fame. You'll be dead anyways, so how can you enjoy it? Instead, live in the
present and make the best of today.

A technique to overcome seeking fame is to trigger disdain on purpose once in a while. For example,
wear something considered ridiculous fashion.

# Personal Values: On Luxurious Living

Wealth can get us luxuries and various pleasures, but won't bring us contentment or banish grief.
Epictetus says:

> it is better to die of hunger with distress and fear gone than to live upset
> in the midst of plenty

Having a luxurious lifestyle causes us to lose our ability to take pleasures in simple things. No
longer can we enjoy a salad and water if our meals mostly consist of grilled steak and wine. Stoics
pity the people who can't enjoy anything but "the best".

Musonius advises us:

* eat to live rather than live to eat
* eat healthy foods that require little preparation
* dress to protect your body, not to impress others
* housing should be functional and no more (shelter from extreme weather)

Seneca advises us:

* life's necessities are cheap and easily obtainable
* eschew luxury and devote more time/energy to more worthwhile causes
* acquire enough wealth to not descend into poverty

If you have wealth, you don't need to renounce it. Stoics can enjoy it but do not get attached to
it.

# Exile: On Surviving a Change of Place

Philosophers were often exiled in Roman times. Modern day exile would be along the lines of being
sent to a nursing home or being required to move somewhere for work.

Musonius says:

> happiness depends more on his values than where he resides

# Old Age: On Being Banished to a Nursing Home

Stoicism is suited for older age. We can appreciate our days more knowing that they are coming to an
end. We can value the tranquility sought out more. We can also respect fatalism - there's nothing we
can do to change our past so don't spend too much time worrying about it.

# Dying: On a Good End to a Good Life

Reasons to fear old age:

* what comes after death or if anything comes after at all
* fear that you mis-lived

A philosophy for life helps you in the second case. As old age comes, you won't fear that you
mis-lived.

The Stoics contemplated death because they wanted to appreciate their life more. This is similar to
negative visualization.

In Roman times, Stoics often took opposing views to people in power - often being sentenced to
death. This is because they wanted to perform their social duty and did not fear death. They did not
think a life in which nothing is worth dying for is worth living

# On Becoming a Stoic: Start Now and Prepared to Be Mocked

Having a philosophy of life simplifies everyday living by easing decision making. Just choose the
ones more aligned by your philosophy's goals. Irvine argues that if you lack a philosophy, it's too
easy to mis-live and pursue goals that aren't worth it.

Irvine advises us to be a **stealth Stoic**. Practice it but keep a low profile to avoid being
mocked.

Some reasons to practice Stoicism:

* experience fewer negative emotions like anger, grief, anxiety
* enjoy tranquility
* take pleasure in the simple things

# The Decline of Stoicism

Stoicism mostly fell off the charts after the collapse of the Roman empire. It competed a bit with
Christianity - but the religion offered an afterlife. Many people lived by Stoic ideals without
actually being Stoics (like Henry Thoreau).

# Stoicism Reconsidered

Advice for seeking tranquility:

* become self-aware and reflect how we respond to the day's events
* use reasoning to overcome negative emotions
* don't pursue wealth, but feel free to enjoy it if received (without clinging)
* be careful about who you become friends with
* unhappiness is caused by insatiability and things out of our control - use negative visualization
  and respect the trichotomy of control

# Practicing Stoicism

Some advice from the author for practicing Stoicism:

* practice stealth Stoicism at first
* don't try to master all techniques at once, do it one at a time
* negative visualization is to daily living as salt is to cooking
* humor is a great tool to use for response
* experiment with voluntary discomfort
* try yoga
* simplify your lifestyle

# A Stoic Reading Program

Some essays to read by Seneca found in "Seneca: Dialogues and Essays":

* On the Happy Life
* On Tranquility of Mind
* On the Shortness of Life

Another good book is Musonius's "The Roman Socrates".

Epictetus's "Handbook" is a short and accessible philosophy book.

Marcus Aurelius wrote in his journal which was published as "Meditations". It's filled with Stoic
advice but doesn't have a coherent theme.
