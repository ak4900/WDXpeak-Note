# Designing for the Web

Mark Boulton teaches us techniques for designing websites that adhere to the principles of web
design in this [web book](http://designingfortheweb.co.uk/book/index.php).

# Getting Started

Boulton explains the current state of web design and our roles within it.

The web browser used to be the only application to access the web. Now, we've got RSS readers,
mobile devices, email clients, and other desktop apps.

10 years ago, the web was only being used by technically savvy users. Now, a more diverse group is
using it for Facebook, email, or blogging.

The web moves fast - and the designer needs to keep up. Boulton tells us how web services became the
norm: Twitter, Vimeo, Flickr, YouTube. These services surprised were quickly accepted and integrated
into various websites.

Boulton will show us the general rules for making typeface choices, knowing what tertiary colour to
use or how to design a five column grid system.

Showing multiple mockups to clients and letting them decide on one is a waste of time. Instead, it's
better to come up with one design approach for a project and iterate quickly on it.

Designers have a lot of tools to work with: paper/pen, IEs, Firefox/Firebug, Safari, Opera,
Photoshop, Illustrator, and text editors.

Web designers need to be T-shaped - a specialist in one area but generalist in many other areas.
You'll need to learn a large amount of technologies just to get started: HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
server-side scripting. But you shouldn't forget your area of speciality. In Boulton's case, it's
applying graphic design to the modern web.

# Research

Design is problem solving. The first step of problem solving is research. You must define the actual
problem and discover possible solutions.

The traditional design process is:

1. Brief - the initial outline from the client, either a RFP or short email.
2. Research - designers need insight into the real world. They need data to get a good sense of how
   a product is being used.
3. Design - the creation step where designers will create a product.
4. Amends - the designer needs to make changes based on client feedback.
5. Production - the final product is made.

The web design process is similar:

1. Brief - comprised of a few documents: client, technical, creative, idea.
2. Research and insight - for a web project this might include: page impressions, unique visitors,
   user flows, persona, use cases, user interviews, focus groups, SWOT analysis (Strengths,
   Weakness, Opportunities, Threats), questionnaires, and market segments.
3. Design ideas - the idea generation step, where designers create a product.
4. Solution - start with a Lo Fi solution like sketches, then test and iterate until you've got the
   final design comp.
5. Production - now implement your design comp for the final product.

Boulton notes that this is just one of many ways that work. Use the best process that fits with your
team and project.

Ask questions, you need to understand the company you're working for and their product. Some
questions you may ask:

* Describe your product/service.
* What are your 3 most important business goals?
* Who is your target market?
* What makes you better than your competition?
* How do you market your product/service?
* What are trends that might affect your product/service?
* If you could communicate any single thing about your company, what would it be?

Do market research about the product or service. Learn their vocabulary. Keep up about their current
events.

Ideas can come from anywhere: other products, unrelated fields, culture. Start with a single problem
and generate your ideas from there:

>  We need to redesign our News service to appeal to a more global audience.

or

>  How do we engage in an older audience for our social networking product?

Use the 4 Rs:

* **Revolution** Take assumptions and reverse/remove them. Like a pub has 4 walls and a roof, but
  what if it didn't have a roof?
* **Re-Expression** Use a different point of view. Eg, what if you were 5 years old and your parents
  were buying you a booster seat - what would make it cooler?
* **Related Worlds** Use ideas from a related world. Eg, what elements of gardening could be used to
  sell more recipe books?
* **Random Links** Force connections between random worlds. Eg, a social networking website and a
  cactus...

Refine your idea with AN. A.B.C.:

* AN - Audience Need Who is the idea for? Will they want to use it? Better, will they need to?
* A - Approach How are you going to implement it?
* B - Benefit What's the benefit you're providing? Is there a competitive advantage?
* C - Competition What's your place in the market?

# Typography

Typefaces have defining characteristics which give them personality.

A typeface will have serifs or not. Missing serifs is called "sans-serif". Serif types are:
bracketed, hairline, flare, or slab.

The thickness of the stroke determines the **whitespace** a character has. **Contrast** is
determined by the difference between stroke thickness.

The **x-height** is determined by the height of the lowercase 'x'. The **cap-height** is height of
capital letters. These are measured from the **baseline** or bottom of most letters. There is also a
**descender line** for letters which extend below the baseline - like 'g', 'q', or 'y'.

**Stress** is the direction of stroke weight, giving it a slant appearance.

**Weight** is the thickness of the stroke. Some broad categories of weight can be: light, medium,
and bold.

The most widely accepted classications are:

1. Graphic - original typeface used by Gutenberg press. Uses heavy metal band. Comic Sans falls into
   this category.
2. Humanist - based on 15th century manuscripts, sub-category of Lineale.
3. Garalde - people wanted typefaces that mimicked natural handwriting.
4. Transitional - lighter than Garalde and less slanted.
5. Didone - elegant type with high contrast and hairline serifs.
6. Slab Serif - strong typeface developed for marketing purposes.
7. Lineale - sans-serif, originally for posters and headlines.
8. Glyphic - stone-carved forms
9. Script - emulates ornate, swishing handwriting
10. Stylised - weird/wonderful typefaces distributed by type geeks

Some classic and iconic typefaces:

* VAG Rounded, developed by Volkswagen as a playful font
* Meta, made as a corporate font. Serious and soulless.
* Mrs. Eaves, redraw of Baskerville - elegant and lightweight.

Typographic **hierarchy** will structure your document. To keep things simple, Boulton only talks
about size and weight.

Europeans developed a scale of font sizes, where each size is a specific ratio of the previous size.
This scale has been used a long time in printing and has become default to most printed material
(and pleasing!)

The scale is: 6pt, 7pt, 8pt, 9pt, 10pt, 11pt, 12pt, 14pt, 18pt, 21pt, 24pt, 36pt

Size really does matter. Before you make your design, plan the sizes of fonts you'll use and stick
to that plan. Make sure they're in the scale.

Typeface weights are different styles within a typeface family. The core family or weights include:
Roman, normal weight, italic, bold, bold italic, and small caps.

There are two reasons to use a different weight: aesthetic problem which requires a visual indicator
or content problem which dictates it. Boulton provides us with a roadmap to use when deciding fonts:

          ___ roman lower case ___                <--- core set
         /           |            \
    small caps    full caps   italic lower case   <--- core set
       |             |             |
    sloped small     |        bold lower case
      caps           |             |
       |             |             |
    bold caps   bold italic   swash and sloped
       |        lower case       caps
        \____________|____________/
                     |
              bold sloped caps

Never moved in two steps. For example, don't move from roman lower case to bold italic lower case.

    +-------------+----------------------------------------+
    | Primary     | Roman Lower Case                       |
    +-------------+----------------------------------------+
    | Secondary   | Roman Upper Case                       |
    |             | Roman Small Caps                       |
    |             | Italic Lower Case                      |
    +-------------+----------------------------------------+
    | Tertiary    | True Italic (Cursive) Upper Case       |
    |             | Sloped Small Caps                      |
    |             | Bold Lower Case                        |
    +-------------+----------------------------------------+
    | Quanternary | False Italic (Sloped Roman) Upper Case |
    |             | Bold Upper Case                        |
    |             | Bold Small Caps                        |
    |             | Bold Italic Lower Case                 |
    +-------------+----------------------------------------+
    | Quintary    | Bold Italic (Sloped Roman) Upper Case  |
    +-------------+----------------------------------------+

**Typesetting** is setting (written material) into type; arrangement of artistic parts so as to form
a unified whole.

The general rule of thumb for legibility is 52-78 characters per line. Your leading show be wider
than your word spacing, otherwise your readers' eyes will stray up/down instead of left/right.

If you use black on white, make sure to increase the leading and tracking. Black on white is higher
contrast and requires more space to read. Lighter weight fonts also help.

You can have incremental leading. This works well for captions that usually have a smaller font
size. For example, a caption could be a fraction of the main leading - aligning their baselines on
every 5th line.

' and " on your keyboard are actually prime and double prime (not quotation marks!). Use `&lsquo;`,
`&rsquo;`, `&ldquo`, `&rdquo` for quotation marks.

Lists should use **hanging bullets**. That is, the bullets should have negative text indent so that
all text is vertically aligned:
   
      Lorem Ipsum
    * First List Item
    * Second List Item
      Dolor Sit Amet

Pull quotes should follow the same convention and be hung to vertically align text so the reader can
flow through more easily.

Some rules for tables:

1. Use a thick rule to denote headlines and thin rule to separate lines.
2. The same row must use the same background color, even if it expands across two lines. Alternate
   background colors between odd/even for readability.
3. If you can, don't use vertical lines.
4. Set table heading in CAPS to give it emphasis.
5. Set a column in bold or set a background color for emphasis.
6. Align numerical data right.
7. Give more padding to bottom of cell than top. This gives a feeling of more white-space, while
   keeping the line-height the same.

A few rules for printing:

1. Avoid absolute positioning.
2. Use points for type measurement, 9-12pt considered optimal.
3. Line-height of 10-16pt is considered optimal.
4. Optimize for black, white, and grey.
5. Don't use too much black, you'll waste ink.
6. Always set type smaller than you think.

# Color

There are two different types of primary colors: additive and subtractive.

The additive primaries are: red, green, blue. These are obtained via lights, combined they form
white. This system is used for computer and TV screens.

The subtractive primaries are: cyan, magenta, yellow. These are obtained by the subtraction of
light. For example, light will be reflected off a piece of white paper - but is absorbed by any
colored ink on that paper. CYMK (K stands for black) is the ink system used for printing.

The color wheel helps classify the colors and helps understand the relationship between each color.
Secondary colors are created by combining primary colors. Tertiary colors are created by combining a
primary/secondary.

**Monochrome** color schemes use only one color from the color wheel. **Complementary** uses two
contrasting colors from opposite sides of the wheel. **Triads** provide tension because each color's
strength is equal. Triad colors use three colors, each equal distance from one another on the wheel.

A color is made up of three things: hue, saturation, and brightness. Hue refers to the tone of the
color. Saturation is the purity or intensity of the color. Think of it as a scale between grey and
the pure color. Brightness refers to how much white or black is contained within a color. Think of
this as two scales: white to the pure color and black to the pure color.

Color combinations can have three types of colors: subordinate or base, dominant or main, and accent
or highlight. The base color is the visually weak one, it should contrast or complement. The main
color defines the communicative values you want. The highlight color can provide tension within a
combination.

Designers should be sensitive to cultural aspects of colors. For example, red is associated with
anger in the West but good luck in the East.

Non-Colors:

* Black - death/mourning in West, authority, official. Should be used sparingly because of perceived
  weight. Users think black pages load faster than white ones.
* White - simplicity, calming mood. Provides a base color which all other colors can work on.

Primaries:

* Red - hot, passion, demanding attention in West. Good fortune, wealth, purity in East. Tricky to
  use due to strength and vibrant. Often used as the accent color. Darken to burgundy to get a
  classier feel.
* Blue - calm, soothing. Dark navy is official. With grey to elicit trust. Paler blue suggests
  youthfulness.
* Yellow - cheerful, happiness. With red it's autumn. With green it's disease and illness. Has
  highest contrast with black (good for warnings).
* Green - nature, calmness, well-being. Vibrant when combined with red or black.

Secondaries and Tertiaries:

* Orange - hot but playful. Natural combo with green/brown.
* Brown - nature. It's easy to replace black with brown.
* Purple - royal color. Used with yellow/green for royalty/wealth. With red or orange to provide
  depth. Associated with mystery and imagination.

Boulton suggests we start with a grayscale project. After we figure out the layout, typography, and
tone - we can start adding color.

# Layout

The **Golden Section**, Golden Ratio, and Divine Proportion are all the same thing. A ratio of
1.618. It occurs everywhere in nature and is often re-used by artists.

Divide your workspace into thirds horizontally and vertically. Align key elements onto where those
lines intersect.

Since we can't be sure of how much vertical space our web page will have on a user's monitor,
Boulton suggests we use the same size as our horizontal width. So a 960px layout will be split into
nine 320x320 pixel squares (or a grid).

The **Looking Room** is the negative space between the edge of a workspace and a subject. Sometimes
called the Lead Room, it's often used in movies and TV shows. An actor will look to the right and
there will be plenty of space between his face and the right-edge of the screen (he'll be placed on
the left).

**Art Direction** is the process of managing visual presentation of content. The Last Supper by Da
Vinci does this using triangles of empty space surrounding the center.

Boulton used a large triangle to manage the reader's eyes for his own web page. The natural reading
order is left to right, top to bottom in the Western world. In the top-left corner he placed a logo.
In the top-right corner, he placed an orange starburst. Finally, at the bottom-left corner he placed
a yellow cover image to draw attention.

There are three types of shapes in classical design: geometric, natural, and abstract. Geometric
shapes are what you'd expect: triangles, circles, squares, rectangles, etc... Natural shapes are
derived from what's around us. Abstract shapes can be representative - impressionistic - or
expressionistic (conveying meaning or emotion).

Shapes have meanings, especially when combined with color. A yellow triangle means warning, proceed
with caution. A green circle means everything is okay.

**Typographic color** refers to the density of type on a page. Too much or too little will make it
difficult to read. You can change the density by adjusting the leading and kerning.

The white space between major elements is called **Macro White Space**. The white space between
minor elements like list items or words is called **Minor White Space**.

**Passive White Space** is used to create breathing room and balance. **Active White Space** is
intentional to navigate the user's eyes from one key element to the next.

**Grid systems** are used to order graphical elements like text or images on a layout. Optimize your
pages for 1024x768, which will accommodate 95% of your users (960px width seems to be common now).

A grid is made up of unit sizes (the width of each box) and gutters. For example, a 50px unit size
width and 10px gutter. 16 columns would be a total width of 940px - there are no gutters on absolute
left and right edges.

Ratios are at the core of grids. Use the golden ratio or rule of thirds to determine your horizontal
lines or how many units to use for a single element.

It's common practice to determine your unit size from your base font size. If your font size is
12pt, it's good to have a unit size that's a multiple of 12pt. By doing this, there will be a direct
relationship between your typography and layout - making it smoother to read.

Boulton mentions the use of CSS frameworks. He warns us to be careful about HTML bloat. Some of the
frameworks he recommends are: Blueprint, 960gs, and Yahoo's UI grid.

It's okay to break from the grid once in a while - Boulton even recommends it. The trick is knowing
when to do it. If a grid isn't working, go back and change its unit size or gutters.

Design for the worse case. What if the font size increases by 200%? What if the editor uploads the
wrong image size? Also take advantage of new technologies. Use progressive enhancements and graceful
degradation.

Almost 80% of your content will be: headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables. Start off your design
with these elements.
