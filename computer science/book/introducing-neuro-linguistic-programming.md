## Introducing Neuro-linguistic Programming

by Joseph O'Connor and John Seymour

### Chapter 1
* pg 3: NLP deals with the structure of human subjective experience; how we organize what we see, hear, and feel, and how we edit and filter the outside world through our senses.
* pg 8: The four stages of learning are unconscious incompetence, conscious incompetence, conscious competence, and unconscious competence. Sometimes you must unlearn, or go back form step 4 to step 2.
* pg 9: If you always do what you've always done, you'll always get what you've always got. If what you're doing isn't working, do something else.
* pg 12: An outcome may only be achievable if several problems are solved first. Convert them into outcomes -- a problem is simply an outcome the wrong way up.
* pg 15: Setting an outcome in the future creates a problem in the present; conversley, every problem in the present can be changed to a future outcome.
* pg 17: A study found that in presenting, body language and eye contact made up over 90% of the impact, while content made up the remainder.
* pg 20: By matching and mirroring body language and tonality you can create rapport, because people who are like each other, like each other.
* pg 22: When building rapport, the word "but" is a destructive word that discounts what others say; "and" is innocent and simply expands on what has been said already.
