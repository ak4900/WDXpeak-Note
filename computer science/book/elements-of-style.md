### I. Elementary Rules of Usage
* pg 1: Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding _'s_, whatever the final consonant.
* pg 2: In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, add a comma after each term except the last.
* pg 2: When using however or a brief phrase as parenthetic, you can omit commas if the sentence flow is only slightly interrupted.
* pg 3: The abbreviation _Jr._ has commonly been regarded as parenthetic, but it is restrictive and should not be preceded by a comma.
* pg 5: If the connective _and_ introduces an independent clause, you can omit the comma if the relation between the two statements is close or immediate.
* pg 6: If a grammatically complete second clause is preceded by an adverb, and not by a conjunction, then a semicolon is still required.
* pg 6: A comma is preferable to a semicolon if the clauses or short and alike in form, or the tone is easy and conversational.
* pg 7: An emphatic word or expression can serve the purpose of a sentence if warranted; this typically happens in dialogue.
* pg 7: A colon has more effect than the comma, less separation than the semicolon, and more formality than the dash.
* pg 8: Join two independent clauses with a colon if the second interprets or amplifies the first.
* pg 9: A dash is a mark of separation stronger than a comma, less formal than a colon, and more relaxed than parentheses.
* pg 9: It is wrong to use a singular verb form in a relative clause following _one of..._ or an expression when the relative is its subject.
* pg 10: With _none_, use a singular verb when the word means _no one_ or _not one_, and a plural verb if it suggests more than one thing or person.
* pg 10: A singular subject remains such even if nouns are connected to it by _with_, _as well as_, _in addition to_, _except_, _together with_, and _no less than_.
* pg 12: A pronoun in a comparison is nomitive if it is the subject of an understood verb. In general, avoid such verbs by supplying them.
* pg 13: A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject.

### II. Elementary Principles of Composition
* pg 15: The first principle of composition is to foresee or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.
* pg 16: Begin a paragraph with a sentence that suggests the topic or one that helps the transition. 
* pg 17: Paragraph breaks used only for show read like the writing of commerce or of display advertising.
* pg 18: The need to make a particular word the subject of a sentence often determines whether active or passive voice is used.
* pg 18: Habitual use of the active voice makes for forcible writing; additionally, the sentence usually becomes shorter.
* pg 20: The reader is dissatisfied with being told only what is not; the reader wishes to be told what is. So express even a negative in a positive form.
* pg 20: Save the auxiliaries _would_, _should_, _could_, _may_, _might_, and _can_ for situations involving real uncertainty.
* pg 21: The surest way to arouse and hold the reader's attention is by being specific, definite, and concrete.
* pg 22: In exposition and argument, even when dealing with general principles, the writer must furnish particular instances of their application.
* pg 23: Write with vigor; this requires not that sentences be short or that detail is avoided, but that every word tell.
* pg 24: _The fact that_ should be revised out of every sentence; _who is_, _which was_, and the like are often superfluous.
* pg 26: Recast loose sentences to remove the monotony; do so however best represents the real relations of the thought.
* pg 26: A likeness of form enables the reader to recognize more readily any likeness of content and function.
* pg 27: When words requiring particular prepositions join in compound construction, all these prepositions must be included, unless they are all the same.
* pg 27: Correlative expressions (_both, and_; _not, but_; _not only, but also_; _either, or_; _first, second_) should be followed by the same grammatical construction.
* pg 28: Bring together words and groups of words that are related in thought, and keep apart those that are not so related.
* pg 29: The subject of a sentence and the principal verb should not be separated by a phrase or clause that can be moved to the beginning.
* pg 29: The relative pronoun, such as _who_, _whom_, _whoever_, _whomever_, _whose_, _that_, or _which_, should immediately follow its antecedent.
* pg 30: Modifiers should come next to the words they modify. If several expressions modify the same word, rearrange so that no wrong relation is suggested.
* pg 31: Keep summaries to one tense; shifting between tenses gives the appearance of uncertainty and irresolution.
* pg 32: The proper place for the word or group of words that the writer wants to make most prominent is at the end.
* pg 33: Any element in the sentence other than the subject becomes emphatic when placed first.

### III. A Few Matters of Form
* pg 34: Use colloquialisms or slang without quotation marks or drawing attention to it.
* pg 34: When two or more words are combined to form a compound adjective, a hyphen is usually required.
* pg 36: Formal quotations cited as documentary evidence are introduced by a colon and enclosed in quotation marks.
* pg 37: Provide references in parentheses or footnotes. Omit words _book_, _volume_, _page_ except when referring to only one of them.
* pg 38: Omit _A_ or _The_ from titles when you place the possessive before them.

### IV. Words and Expressions Commonly Misused
* pg 39: _Aggravate_ is to add to an already troublesome matter; _irritate_ is to vex or annoy.
* pg 40: When more than two are involved but each is considered individually, _between_ is preferred over _among_.
* pg 40: Replace _and/or_ by using _or_ and appending _or both_.
* pg 41: Replace _as to whether_ with _whether_, _regarded as being_ with _regarded as_, and _as yet_ with _yet_ if equivalent.
* pg 42: Drop _case_, such as in _in many cases_ or _been the case_, as well as _certainly_.
* pg 42: Do not use _certainly_ or use _very_ indiscriminately to intensify any and every statement; 
* pg 43: Use _compare to_ to highlight similarities in different things, and _compare with_ to highlight differences in similar things.
* pg 43: A collective is _comprised_ of many things, while many things _constitute_ a collective.
* pg 44: One thing differs from another, and so use _different from_ instead of _different than_.
* pg 45: _Each and every one_ is pitchman's jargon and should be avoided.
* pg 45: Use _enormity_ in the sense of "monstrous wickedness." It is misleading, if not wrong, to use to express bigness.
* pg 46: Using _etc_ is incorrect at the end of a list introduced by _such as_ or _for example_. In formal writing, _etc_ is a misfit.
* pg 46: _Farther_ best serves as a distance word, while _further_ as a time or quantity word.
* pg 47: _Feature_, like _factor_, usually adds nothing to the sentence in which it occurs.
* pg 47: _Fortuitous_ means limited to what happens by chance, and should not be used for _fortunate_ or _lucky_.
* pg 48: Use _hopefully_ to mean _with hope_, as opposed to _I hope_ or _it is to be hoped_.
* pg 48: _However_ can start a sentence if it means _in whatever way_ or _two whatever extent_; otherwise you mean _nevertheless_.
* pg 49: _In regards too_ is incorrect, while either _in regard to_ or _as regards_ is correct.
* pg 50: Reserve _insightful_ for instances of remarkably penetrating vision; otherwise use perceptive or a similar word.
* pg 50: Be wary of words that end in _-ize_. Use simpler, unpretentious words instead, like _use_ instead of _utilize_.
* pg 51: Use _kind of_ and _sort of_ in a literal sense.
* pg 51: _Like_ governs nouns and pronouns; before phrases and clauses the equivalent word is _as_.
* pg 52: _Loan is a noun_; as a verb, prefer _lend_.
* pg 53: _Nature_ is redundant when used like _character_; otherwise it should be avoided in vague expressions.
* pg 53: _Nauseous_ means sicking to contemplate, while _nauseated_ means sick at the stomach.
* pg 54: _Offputting_ can mean different things in different contexts, so replace it with a word that has clear meaning.
* pg 55: _Partially_ means to a certain degree when speaking of a condition or state; _partly_ carries the idea of a part as distinct from the whole.
* pg 55: Replace the present participle with a verbal noun (gerund) to emphasize the verb and not the subject.
* pg 56: _Personalize_ and _possess_ are pretentious words that should be replaced, while _personally_ can usually be omitted.
* pg 57: Do not carelessly use _regretful_ in place of _regrettable_.
* pg 57: You can usually omit _respective_ and _respectively_ without introducing ambiguity.
* pg 58: In formal writing, the future tense requires _shall_ for the first person, and _will_ for the second and third.
* pg 58: Restrict _state_ to the sense of expressing fully or clearly, instead of using it as a substitute for _say_ or _remark_.
* pg 59: Any sentence with _than_ should be examined to make sure that no essential words are missing.
* pg 59: _That_ is the defining, or restrictive, pronoun; _which_ is the non-defining, or nonrestrictive, one.
* pg 60: To avoid overusing _he or she_, try using the plural, eliminating the pronoun, or substituting the second person for the third person.
* pg 61: Replace _this_ when it refers to the complete sense of a preceding sentence or clause, as it may be imprecise.
* pg 62: _Transpire_ is not a synonym for _happen_, while _type_ is not a synonym for _kind of_.
* pg 62: _Unique_ means without like or equal, and so there should be no degrees of uniqueness using _most_ or _very_.
* pg 63: Use _very_ sparingly; where emphasis is necessary, use words strong in themselves.
* pg 63: Avoid indiscriminately substituting _while_ for _and_, _but_, and _although_; replace it with _at the same time_ to judge its absurdity.
* pg 64: The suffix _-wise_ should only be used when it refers to a manner, like _clockwise_.
* pg 64: Phrases like _once a year_, _each Sunday_, or the past tense are more brief and emphatic by omitting _would_.
* pg 64: Indicate the transition from sentences that state a general habit to those that express the action of a specific day or period.

### V. An Approach to Style
* pg 69: The approach to style is by way of plainness, simplicity, orderliness, and sincerity.
* pg 70: To achieve style, begin by affecting none, thereby placing yourself in the background.
* pg 70: Write in a way that comes easily and naturally to you. Never imitate consciously, but don't worry about being an imitator.
* pg 71: Write with nouns and verbs, not with adjectives and adverbs.
* pg 72: Rich, ornate prose is hard to digest, so rewrite your writing later and ruthlessly delete the excess.
* pg 73: Do not overstate, as a single carefree superlative has the potential to destroy, for readers, the object of your enthusiasm.
* pg 73: Avoid the use of qualifiers such as _rather_, _very_, _little_, and _petty_.
* pg 75: Do not explain too much, as it is seldom advisable to tell all.
* pg 77: Only the writer whose ear is reliable is in a position to use bad grammar deliberately.
* pg 78: Don't use dialect unless you are a devoted student of the tongue you hope to reproduce, and if you do, apply it consistently.
* pg 79: If mired in a sentence, typically the construction has become too involved, and the sentence should be broken into two.
* pg 79: Do not inject opinion into a piece of writing; they leave the mark of egotism on a work.
* pg 80: Do not take shortcuts at the cost of clarity. The only reliable shortcut is to choose words that are strong and surefooted.
* pg 82: To use language well, do not hack it to bits; accept the whole body of it, cherish its classic form, its variety, and its richness.
* pg 84: Style takes its final shape more from attitudes of mind than from principles of composition.
* pg 84: You must sympathize with the reader's plight, but never seek to know his the reader's wants. Write for yourself.
