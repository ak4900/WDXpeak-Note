# The Non Designer's Design Book

This book is for people who don't want to or don't have the time to learn design. It won't replace 4
years of schooling, but it'll teach you what to look for when you don't like a design. Robin
Williams guides us through the basic principles of design.

# Principles
Good design is as easy as:

1. Learn the principles
2. Recognize when you're not using them
3. Apply the principles

The four basic principles are CRAP:

* **Contrast** - avoid elements that are similar but not the same. Make them very different.
  Contrast draws your readers to a design in the first place.
* **Repetition** - repeating visual elements creates organization and unity.
* **Alignment** - every element should have a connection to at least one other. This creates a clean
  and sophisticated look.
* **Proximity** - items related to each other should be grouped close together. This helps organize,
  reduce clutter, and gives structure.

# Proximity

Group related items together to form a cohesive group Items that are not related should not be close
together.

Grouping also clears communication to your readers. It's much easier to digest information at a
glance when all related info is grouped.

Which list is better?

    *Motifs*                     *Motifs*
    Snakes                        Snakes
    Mornings                      Mornings
    *Collections*
    Small printings              *Collections*
    Dingbats                      Small printings
    *Thematic*                    Dingbats
    Villains and saints
    Music                        *Thematic*
                                  Villains and saints
                                  Music

Headlines should not be equal distance from both copy above and below. It should be further from the
copy above and closer to the copy it represents.

Which copy is better?

    *Headline*                   *Headline*
    Lorem ipsum dolor             Lorem ipsum dolor
    *Headline 2*
    Lorem ipsum dolor            *Headline2*
    *Headline 3*                  Lorem ipsum dolor
    Lorem ipsum dolor

Be conscious of where your eye is going. Where does it start at? Where does it go next? What path is
it following?

Williams recommends that we squint our eyes and look at a page to see how many units there are. If
they are too many, think about grouping more elements together.

Avoid moving elements just to cover up empty white space. Avoid too many separate elements on a
page. Don't create proximity relationships with elements that don't belong together.

# Alignment

Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily, everything should have a visual connection to
something else.

Moving all elements to the right gives it alignment and makes it look much more organized. The
strength of the right edge gives the strength of layout.

Don't play it safe with a center alignment. Williams comments that it's too ordinary. Most layouts
you like break way from center alignment. Combine your layouts with proximity and left/right
alignment for strength.

Williams recommends that we stick to one text alignment per page until we've got more experience
with design.

Never center headlines over flush left body copy or text that has an indent. The purpose of
indenting paragraphs is to tell when a new one starts. Using white space in between paragraphs is
fine.

Find a strong line and use it. If there is left aligned text and a right floated image, it creates
awkward white space in between. If you right align the text - you'll get a single strong line for
alignment.

It's possible to break free of alignment, if it's done consciously:

        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit,
        sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna
    --------------  aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud
    Excepteur sint  exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip 
    --------------  ex ea commodo consequat.  Duis aute irure dolor
        reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat
        nulla pariatur.  Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non.

Similar to contrast, avoid similar alignments. If it's not completely the same, break the alignment
consciously.

Unity is an important element of design. To make a layout appear unified, there needs to be a
connection between every element on the page. Nothing should look out of place.

# Repetition

Repeat some aspect of the design throughout the entire piece.

You already use repetition: bullet lists, font style headings, borders. Beginners need to push this
further. Once again, Williams tells us to be conscious. Turn the unconscious act of repetition into
a visual key.

Williams uses the example of the card again. This time, she bolds the last item on the card as well
as the center. When your eye travels to the last item, it tends to drift back towards the center
where the other bold item was:

                  +----------------------------------+
                  |                  *Mermaid Tavern*|
                  |                    Ralph Doister |
                  |                                  |
                  |                1027 Beard Street |
                  |                       London, NM |
                  |                    *555-123-4567*|
                  +----------------------------------+

Repeated items don't always have to be the same. They can just have the same theme. For example,
showing multiple character designs which overlap borders. Or repeating triangles - even if they're
different colors.

Think of repetition as being consistent - then push it a bit further. Use it to unify your design
and add visual interest. Think about adding an element whose sole purpose is for repetition.

Avoid overwhelming your viewer with repetition.

# Contrast

Contrast is the most effective way to add visual interest. There's one important rule for contrast.
Don't be a wimp.

Contrast happens when two elements are extremely different. If they're sort of different it's a
conflict instead of contrast. If two items are not exactly the same, then make them completely
different.

Some examples of contrast:

* large type with small type
* graceful old style font with bold sans serif font
* thin line with a thick line
* cool color with warm color
* smooth texture with rough texture
* horizontal and vertical
* small graphic and large graphic

Some examples of conflicting elements:

* 12pt with 14pt
* dark brown with black

Using bold text as contrast is a great way to draw the reader's eyes and get their attention.

Williams walked us through redesigning an ad. Some suggestions were:

1. Let go of Times Roman and Arial/Helvetica.
2. Let go of center alignment.
3. Find the most interesting element on the page and emphasize it. If there are multiple interesting
   elements, group them together and focus.
4. Group logical items together, use space to set groups apart.
5. Find elements you can repeat.
6. Add contrast.

Our eyes like contrast, it will draw us to the page. Almost only counts in horseshoes and hand
grenades. Avoid being a wimp. Experiment.

# Using Color

This chapter includes a brief explanation of the color wheel, color relationships, shades/tints,
tones, warm vs cold colors, and CMYK vs RGB.

Since most of her readers are interested in design for print, Williams uses the CMYK model to
explain the color wheel.

The primary colors are: Yellow, Red, and Blue. The secondary colors are: Green, Purple, and Orange.
Secondary colors are retrieved by combining two primary colors. Tertiary colors are made by
combining a primary and secondary color. The most common way to display these colors is on a wheel,
where the primaries all start out equal distance from one another.

Some interesting themes occur with the color wheel. These color combinations are guaranteed to work
well together:

* **Complementary** - 2 colors on opposite sides of one another. Because they're opposite, it's best
  if one is used as the main and the other is an accent.
* **Triad** - set of 3 colors all equal distance from one another on the wheel. The primary triad
  (RYB) is common in children's products.
* **Split Complement** - choose one color, then choose the two neighbors of its complement.
* **Analogous** - color combo where each color is next to each other on the wheel. Combined with
  shades/tints, this makes a very harmonious and interesting combo.
* **Monochromatic** - one color whose brightness is adjusted to create various tints and shades.

The pure color itself is called a **Hue**. You can adjust it's **Brightness** by adding black or
white. Adding black creates a **Shade** and adding white creates a **Tint**. Using shades and tints
with the color combinations described above will create attractive themes.

**Tone** or **Saturation** refers to the particular quality, vibrant, or deepness of a hue. I've
also heard it's similar to adding more gray to your color (as opposed to white/black for
brightness).

Colors tend to be on the warm side or cool side. Warmer colors have red or yellow in them. Cooler
colors have blue in them. Cool colors work well for backgrounds. Warmer colors work well to make
things stand out in the foreground. Williams warns us about using too much warm colors - it may
overwhelm your readers. Stick with cooler colors for large amounts.

CYMK stands for Cyan (blue), Yellow, Magenta (red/pink), and Black. It's a subtractive system which
is used for print. With these 4 inks, you can make thousands of colors. Light hits the ink, which is
reflected into your eyes.

RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue. It's an additive system where light will directly enter your
eyes. Combined, they make white. The absence of light makes black. This is the system used for
computer monitors and TVs.

Williams suggests we select our colors before the project begins.

# Type & Life

When choosing typefaces there are three different relationships:

* **Concordant** - the same typeface, maybe with different weights or styles. Your overall design
  will be harmonious - but maybe boring.
* **Conflict** - similar typefaces but not exactly the same. This causes awkwardness in your design
  and should be avoided.
* **Contrast** - Strong contrast attracts the eyes. If two typefaces are not exactly the same they
  should be completely different.

There are six clear ways to contrast type: size, weight, structure, form, direction, and color.

If you're experiencing trouble, don't look for what's similar between choices. Look for what's
different.

# Categories of Type

There are too many typefaces to categorize them all, but most can be broadly fit into these 6
categories:

1. **Oldstyle** - based on the handlettering of scribes. Lowercase serifs always have a slant.
   Letters always have transitions from thin to thick. It's perfect for larger bodies of text.
2. **Modern** - due to smoother paper and better printer techniques, a modern style became
   available. Serifs are always horizontal and thin. There's no slant. Moderns have a cold, elegant
   look. They have a striking appearance. It's good for large fonts, but poor for large bodies of
   text.
3. **Slab serif** - made for advertising. The thick/thin transition made it difficult to read from
   far away, so slab serif got rid of it. Everything is thick. Many typefaces are named after an
   Egyptian theme. They're suitable for large bodies of text because they're so readable.
4. **Sans serif** - "sans" meaning without in French, these typefaces are without serifs and are
   uniform in weight (no thick/thin transition). Most famous is Helvetica.
5. **Script** - typefaces with a calligraphy theme. Williams says it's like cheesecake - use
   sparingly or get sick.
6. **Decorative** - these are fun, distinctive, and easy to use.

# Type Contrasts

Organization of a page should be understandable at a glance. Use type contrast to meet this goal.
Williams goes over the size ways to contrast:

1. **Size** - don't contrast 12pt with 14pt. If you're going to contrast with size, you must make it
   obvious to your reader.
2. **Weight** - refers to thickness of a type's stroke. Most families are designed with: regular,
   bold, extra bold, semibold, or light. Never contrast regular with semibold. Always go at least 2
   levels apart.
3. **Structure** - refers to how the typeface was built. Some are monoweight, others have very
   noticeable thick/thin transitions.
4. **Form** - the shape of a typeface. "G" and "g" may have the same structure in a font family but
   almost always have different forms. The easiest way to distinguish with form is caps vs
   lowercase.
5. **Direction** - you can slant your type to create contrast with direction. Slanting upwards
   creates positive energy, downwards is the opposite. A long line of type has horizontal direction.
   A thin column of type has vertical direction. You can also use these "directions" to contrast.
6. **Color** - remember to keep in mind warm colors vs cold colors. Typographers also consider
   black/white type as different colors. Use a darker black to convey importance.

Williams recommends to never put two typefaces from the same category on the same page.
