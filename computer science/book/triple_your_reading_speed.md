# Triple Your Reading Speed
Wade E. Cutler teaches techniques to read faster with the same comprehension. This book includes eye
exercises to control/expand vision, various drills to improve techniques, tactics/strategies for
overall better comprehension.

Although the advice for improving reading speed is good to have, it is worthless without practicing
the drills in this book.

He references the "10% of your brain" usage (incorrect) to try to convince the non-believers. Let's
try this book out anyway.

# Part 1: Learn About Reading Yourself

## Current Reading Rate/Comprehension
Cutler has the reader determine his reading rate and comprehension with two short narratives
followed by multiple choice tests. My rate is 228 WPM with a comprehension of 85%.

## How You Learned to Read Slowly
Reading is taught by having children speak the words out loud. Eventually, teachers tell children to
read to themselves - but the vocalization still occurs within their heads. Our reading rate becomes
limited to our speech rate.

We can understand words visually instead of sounding them out in our minds. By doing this, we lift
the restriction of our reading rate being maxed out by our speech.

## Visual "Bite"
**Fixations** occur when we read - our eyes are fixated along certain points. Our vision then reads
the words around those fixations. The less fixations we have, the faster we can read.

"Accelerated Readers" have fewer fixations; only 2 per line. Cutler has us read more narratives by
Edgar Allan Poe to determine how many we have per line. He encourages us to come back to this
exercise frequently as we practice accelerated reading to see its effects.

## Rewards of Accelerated Reading
Reading faster actually improves comprehension because we can read an entire novel/book within one
sitting. Since the entire text is absorbed in a shorter amount of time, we tend to understand it
better.

For example, if you watched a movie in 15 minute intervals you'd most likely forget the plot during
your 3rd or 4th visit to the theaters. The same happens with books - we can't devote enough time for
a single sitting throughout a novel. With "Accelerated Reading", we'll be able to read an entire
text at once.

# Part 2: Identify and Overcome Your Blocks to Better Reading

The five "blocks" which slows down reading speed is:

1. Failure to Preview
2. Wasted Eye Movement
3. Poor Vision Span
4. Vocalization and Subvocalization
5. Miscallaneous (point-making, hand scanning, slow page turning)

## Failure to Preview
Previewing has many benefits:

* avoid wasted reading time on something you don't need
* estimating how long it will take by knowing length of text
* knowing the conclusion before reading
* knowing which material you need to absorb while reading
* knowing which material you can safely ignore
* knowing whether the material is new knowledge or a review

To preview a nonfiction book:

1. Examine the cover (title, blurbs, summaries, reviews)
2. Note the author's name and read any short bios for him/her
3. Check the publisher's name and copyright date
4. Read the front matter (intro, preface, foreword)
5. Carefully read over the table of contents
6. Thumb through the book to discover its general layout and length
7. Read any overall summary/conclusion carefully
8. Peruse indexes, bibliographies, or glossaries
9. From the preview, evaluate the book's value for your purpose

To preview a chapter:

1. Study the title
2. Question the title: a. What do I already know? b. Will this be a review or contain unfamiliar
   info? c. What are the logical points to look for? d. What will be the writer's attitude/approach?
   e. Does the title suggest his conclusion?
3. Note the number of pages
4. Read the first paragraph
5. Read the last paragraph
6. If there's a summary or conclusion, read it carefully
7. Look over any study questions or problem sets at the end
8. Page through the entire chapter
9. Reflect on what you've learned by this preview and what you expect to gain by reading this
   chapter

## Wasted Eye Movement
Wasted eye movement occurs through regressions, progressions, and distractions.

**Regressions** happen when you re-read a section or previous lines. **Progressions** occur when you
get bored and begin to pre-read the lines in front of your cursor. **Distractions** occur when
reading gets tiresome and you look away.

Cutler suggests that previewing will help with regressions, since you know exactly when you should
pay attention and absorb the materials.

You should simply just stop progressions. They don't help. When you begin reading, find a
comfortable/quiet spot which allows you to concentrate.

When you get tired, designate a time to take breaks. Get away both physically and mentally to
recoup. By batch processing reading, you can finish quickly instead of getting distracted.

## Poor Vision Span
WPM is determined by the number of fixations a reader has. To reduce that number, you'll have to
train your eyes to see a larger area around each fixation.

Cutler compares this to a basketball player who practices and develops a peripheral vision to see
other players around him.

## Vocalization and Subvocalization
Vocalization is reading out loud. Subvocalization occurs when the reader silently reads to himself.
This is easy to spot for people with lip, throat, or diaphragm movements.

Comprehension should be done visually. Cutler explains how we visually understand words everyday -
from shopping for items to driving.

## Miscallaneous
Do not cover the book with anything as you read. It was common to teach children to read by guiding
them with a ruler or index card and moving it down as the reader progresses. This slows reading down
because it prevents any vision expansion.

Page turning might seem minor, but can add up to 13 minutes to a novel. It's best to read the book
flat on a table and feel out the corner of the right page while reading the left page.

# Part 3: Become an Accelerated Reader

## Develop Eye Control and Expand Vision
This chapter includes various drills to develop your eye control and expand vision. The drills
involve columns of letters, we're supposed to focus on the middle column only and read inside-out.

If your focus drifts away from the middle letter, it means you need to develop better eye control
and practice more. While doing this, you should be expanding your peripheral vision.

It's a bit ironic that one of the reading blocks is vocalization and sub-vocalization and that's
what these drills encourage (reading letters out loud or to yourself).

## Read Wider and Deeper
These drills are meant to expand your peripheral vision as well as learning to use one fixation per
two lines.

## Learn Pacing and Block Reading
Reading with a single fixation per multiple lines can get tiresome. These drills are meant for your
to develop a pace and keep it for your reading. This way, you can calculate your targeted WPM and
read at a steady rate.

Cutler also mentions that you should stop sub-vocalization now. While doing the drills, count the
number for each line and learn to read by sight instead.

## Master the Two-Stop Method
The two-stop method works by having two fixations per line, one at the quarter mark and the next at
the 3rd-quarter mark. It's important to come to a complete stop, if blurring occurs it's because
you're no fixating at two stops.

For this drill, you should be counting 1-2 repeatedly for each line to prevent any sub-vocalization
of the text.

Cutler recommends that the two-stop method should become natural when reading any text. After
mastering it, you should practice with one fixation per two lines.

# Part 4: Develop Your Skills Further

## Estimating Number of Words
Estimating the number of words is important so you can determine how long it should take you to read
it and set your pace.

Cutler recommends counting how many words there are per line (for up to 4 lines), then counting how
many lines there are per page. Use this to figure out the estimated number of words per page.

Now see how many pages there are and calculate the total number of words.

Before you begin reading, use this estimation to determine your pace. So if a document is ~5000
words in 5 pages and you wish to read it in 10 minutes:

    5000 / 10 = 500 WPM
    5000 / 5 = ~1000 words per page
    ~2 minutes per page allotted

## Quarter and Mark
Cutler recommends dividing a book into quarters and setting your pace accordingly instead of on a
per-page basis. Note how many pages are in each quarter and determine your time-limit to finish
reading them.

He also suggests that you finish the entire book in one sitting for better comprehension.

As you start "accelereading", you may want to re-read portions of the book to get better
comprehension. As time progresses and you get more practice, you shouldn't have to re-read anymore.
