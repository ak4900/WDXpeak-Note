# Focus

A concise guide by Leo Babauta on how to focus to create.

## Step Back: Introduction and Importance of Focus

We live in the Age of Distraction: overwhelming ringing phones, email notifications, social network
messaging, browser tabs, mobile devices, and more. These distractions are everywhere - even while
we're working and trying to create.

There's a lot competing for attention. It's difficult to focus on real work. Being connected has
become a new lifestyle and has even become expected of us. Those who create must find focus to do
good work.

**Creating is a completely separate process from consuming and communicating.**

It's best to separate your day: a time for creating and another for consuming. Leo wakes up and
refuses to turn on the internet - that's creation time.

To achieve disconnection:

1. **Unplug your wifi, router, or network.**
2. Have a disconnect time each day and make it a habit.
3. Work somewhere without a connection.
4. Get outside and leave your devices behind.
5. Leave your mobile device behind or airplane mode.
6. Use blocking software if your work requires a computer.
7. Alternate connection and disconnection.
8. Disconnect away from work once in a while (take a break).

Break a connection addiction by taking away its positive feedback and replacing it with a new habit:

1. List out what triggers your need for connection.
2. Find a new routine to replace the old habit of connection.
3. Try changing each habit one at a time (like instead of waking up to check Hacker News, open up
   your text editor instead).
4. Create positive feedback for the new habit, some sort of reward.
5. Create negative feedback for the old habit.

Leo practices focus rituals:

1. Morning quiet - wake up early and disconnected
2. Start of day - start creating immediately or do your 3 most important tasks
3. Refocus ritual - every hour or two disconnect and refocus on work
4. Alternate focus/rest - it's good to ease your mind once in a while
5. Alternate two focuses - switch between two projects for variety
6. Communicate then block - reward yourself with connection on breaks
7. End of day - review what you did
8. Weekly focus - weekly review of what you've done and how to do it better

## Clear Distractions

There's a huge stream of distractions that we need to limit: email, IMs, Twitter, Facebook, forums,
blogs, social networks, news sites, phones, text messages, Skype, podcasts, alerts, notifications,
TV, radio, and more.

**Become more conscious of your consumption** and choose carefully. Leo suggests starting from
scratch and only put back what's absolutely necessary or what you love to consume. **You can't read
and consume everything.**

Try an information cleanse: don't check email, Twitter, Facebook, forums, or any news sites. This
will tell you what's really important. Now you know what you can get off your plate. Once you've
reduce your streams of information, reduce the time you spend on it as well.

That's the "pull" side of the equation. What about the "push" side, like incoming text messages? You
don't need to respond. Set blocks of time where you're disconnected. When the block of time is over,
feel free to respond. Batch emails, IMs, and text messaging.

**Let go of the need to stay updated!** Empty out your RSS reader. Start with a clean slate on
Twitter and be conscious of who you follow. Unsubscribe to those email newsletters you never read.
Give Inbox Zero a chance.

Distraction is useful in some cases: offers a break, can lead to inspiration, it's fun, and can lead
to better focus later on. That's what scheduling blocks is for.

## Simplify to Prepare

Simplifying what's around you will help clear distractions:

1. Clear your physical workspace
2. Clean up your desktop (less notifications, less desktop icons, etc...)
3. Find soothing music and some headphones

**Turn off notifications!** You don't need new information being pushed onto you at all times. This
goes for emails, IMs, calendars, Twitter, etc...

If your goal is to create quality instead of quantity, consider slowing down. Moving slow gives you
better/deeper focus, appreciation, and enjoyment. There's also less stress. Tips for moving slower:

1. Do less
2. Have fewer meetings
3. Practice disconnecting
4. Give yourself breaks
5. Get comfortable with sitting and doing nothing
6. Realize if it doesn't get done - it's okay
7. Eliminate the unnecessary
8. Practice mindfulness
9. Slowly eliminate commitments

Also learn to go with the flow. There will be interruptions. Learn how to get back into your
disconnected state. Realize you can't control everything.

Learn to **get in the zone**, your most productive and effective state. You'll be able to work
effortlessly and produce high quality work:

1. Act because of passion.
2. Change course when it becomes too difficult - perhaps to something you're more excited about.
3. Don't try to control what's uncontrollable
4. Be flexible
5. Find the pressure points or maximum effective points
6. Do less and less, but do it better

To simplify your tasks:

1. Reduce the number of tasks to what's important
2. Choose tasks that excites you
3. Single task
4. Do your Most Important Tasks first thing in the morning. Let smaller tasks fill up the rest of
   the day.

Simplify your life: less possessions, less commitments, less stress:

1. Learn to say "no" to others
2. Learn to do less
3. Pick your life's big picture list that's crucial for you to accomplish
4. Start systematically removing the unimportant and unnecessary

## Find Focus

Three simple steps for getting amazing things done:

1. Find something amazing to work on - consider making a manifesto or philosophy as a guide for
   yourself to decide what to work on.
2. Clear away everything else.
3. Focus on that something amazing.

When you're creating be sure to single-task. Don't attempt to multi-task because you'll just be
doing multiple things poorly. Focus on one thing at a time. When you're done, move on. If other
tasks come up, jot it down on a list.

This works for reading and researching also. Clear away all the distractions and do your work. You
can save material offline so you can switch off your internet connection.

Leo also suggests going on short walks to find focus. Consider working for a 20-40 minute interval
followed by a brisk walk. Repeat throughout the day.

Creativity killers include:

* distractions - we've talked about how to clear these
* intimidation - too large of a task may scare us, break it up into smaller tasks
* pressure - deadlines and managers prevent relaxation and focus, solitude helps
* lack of use - it's difficult if you haven't created in a while, habits help

> The mind is sharper and keener in seclusion and uninterrupted solitude.
> - Nikola Tesla

Give solitude a chance! It will help you find focus. Try using relaxing music with earbuds if you
can't get your own office space.

To achieve your creativity peak:

* find deep focus in isolation and freedom of distractions
* do small tasks instead of intimidating huge tasks
* constantly practice each day as a habit
* enjoy what you're doing
* relax when you feel too pressured, take a break
* get inspired by what you're doing
* shake things up and change your routine once in a while
* become an early riser and work before the rest of the world is up
