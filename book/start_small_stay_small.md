# Start Small, Stay Small

Rob Walling gives tactical advice for developers who want to launch their own software business
without outside funding.

# Chasm Between Developer and Entrepreneur

This book is aimed at:

1. Micropreneurs - entrepreneurs who want zero employees and have a lifestyle goal
2. Bootstrappers - aiming to create/own/grow a company with employees

The ideal person for this book is or will be (after reading this book):

1. Technical and can create software for a niche market
2. Able to merge technical and marketing knowledge
3. Cross between developer, webmaster, and marketer

Rob emphasizes **product last, marketing first**. Marketing is far more important than developers
give it credit for.

The wrong reasons to start a micro business:

1. Having a product idea
2. To get rich
3. Because it sounds like fun

The right reasons is to attain a lifestyle goal (freedom, income independence, location
independence). Some example goals:

1. Keeping a day job and earning extra money on the side
2. Building a portfolio of products and quitting the day job
3. Quitting the day job to run your own small, bootstrapped company

The biggest roadblocks to your success will be:

1. No market, you must research the market first instead of building something nobody wants!
2. Fear, lack of confidence may prevent you from launching.
3. Lack of goals and motivation
4. Inconsistency (losing momentum is dangerous and you may abandon your project)
5. Believing you have to do everything yourself

Rob suggests building a product after verifying the market, writing down your goals, going on an
information diet, and getting comfortable with outsourcing to contractors.

Be sure to dollarize your time to determine what you want to earn from your project. A good way to
do this is using an existing freelance rate or dividing your salary by 2,000. You'll probably start
somewhere around $25-$50/hour. As you develop your project, aim for $100/hour. It's a good long-term
goal.

With your new hourly rate, you'll realize:

1. Outsourcing is a bargain!
2. Focus on work or focus on play, don't mix
3. Wasting time is a big waste of money
4. Information consumption is usually a waste of time, don't consume something unless it provides
   actionable advice! (eg. business books are a waste of time)

To transition from developer to entrepreneur, you'll need to realize:

1. Being a good technician isn't enough, you need to be a good visionary and manager too
2. Market comes first, marketing second, aesthetic third, and functionality fourth
3. Nothing is ever clear
4. You need a plan, even if it's never accurate
5. Fail fast and recover fast is a good thing
6. You'll never be finished
7. Never expect instant gratification, it takes hard work

# Why Niches are the Name of the Game

The best approach for small businesses is to pick a niche market and cater to them. Online
accounting system is bad, but aimed at web developers is good.

Why niches are awesome:

1. Niches narrow your product focus and makes it easier to create
2. Advertising is more cost effective!
3. Niches have less competition
4. Niches have higher profit margins
5. Niches aren't used to good marketing
6. It's easier for prospects to trust you when you have laser focus on them

The best approach for deciding a product to make: you want a market that's already looking for your
product. You don't want to create a whole new market or to serve a market that doesn't know it has a
problem. You want your market to be online so you can reach them.

Vertical markets are better than horizontals:

1. Members of verticals have same behavior
2. They talk to each other and hang out together, so it's easier to reach them
3. They have similar needs, so it's easier to serve them

# Your Product

Your product's success depends on the Product Success Triangle:

1. Product - has to be good
2. Market - a group must be willing to pay for it
3. Execution - market, sell, and support it

Rob suggests outsourcing the development, since you have more strategic things to do such as
marketing. It will free up a lot of time, especially if you're doing this as a side project.

Some guidelines for pricing your product:

* consumer hobby products top out at $29 fixed or $14/month
* consumer products that save money top out at $49 fixed or $19/month
* small business products top out at $400 or $99/month
* larger business products top out at $1,000 or $199/month

Some advice on pricing:

1. Know your market
2. Ask yourself what would you pay and what feels right
3. Check out your competition's pricing
4. Determine our product's value in terms of how it saves your customer's time/money
5. Combine steps 1-4 to determine a price range
6. Lean towards higher pricing, developers tend to undervalue their software
7. Use three tiers
8. End in 7, 8, or 9
9. Determine benefits for each tier
10. Consider adding a fee for support
11. For recurring payments, consider fixed price divided by 12
12. Test the numbers in the wild

Some product types that developers can make:

1. Hosted web applications
2. Downloadable web applications
3. Desktop applications
4. Mobile applications
5. Third party plugins
6. Community websites

# Building a Killer Sales Website

The typical sales funnel looks like this:

1. Person sees your URL via link in another article, ad, or site
2. They click to become a site visitor
3. Stick around for more than a few seconds to become a prospect
4. After some researching, they become a buyer

At each step of the funnel, you'll be losing people. The chance of them becoming a buyer is small.
The chance of them becoming a buyer on the first visit is almost zero. After launch, you'll need to
spend some time working on your sales website:

1. Marketing - getting more exposure from blogs, ads, forums, etc...
2. Conversion - engage visitors with content, convince them to provide email address, etc...
3. Nurturing - nurture your prospects and honing your website pitch

The reality of the sales process looks more like:

1. Potential customer does a Google search related to your product
2. They click on your ad costing you 50 cents
3. They scan through your website, demo page, go to pricing page
4. They make a mental note, leave your website, and never come back

Rob suggests that we convince visitors to give an email address. With an email address, you can
build a relationship through relevant emails and gentle reminders. Do three things:

1. Establish trust - you're a legitimate source of information to them
2. Establish relevance - your product is relevant to their needs
3. Establish reward - offer something in exchange for the email (sometimes called a magnet)

Start by building a customer profile, this will help determine your website's copy/design. Determine
who your ideal customer is, how they feel when arriving to your site, what keeps them awake at
night, what are they afraid/angry of, what are their frustrations, what do they desire, do they have
their own jargon?

From all this information, establish copy (headlines and call to actions especially). Some
guidelines for your website:

1. Home page isn't necessarily the most visited page
2. Every page needs a call to action
3. Every page needs a single focus
4. Everything should be within 2 clicks
5. Accommodate different reading patterns (skimmers + people who read every word)
6. Make buttons look like buttons
7. No one reads, use audio/video/images

The core pages are:

1. Home
2. Tour
3. Testimonials
4. Contact Us
5. Pricing & Purchase

The #1 goal of your website should be to get them to sign up for an email newsletter. Some tips for
email marketing:

1. Never email someone without their permission
2. Every email must include an unsubscribe link
3. Never sell or rent out your email list
4. Use double opt-in for highest quality subscribers
5. Give something away for free to get subscribers (eg PDF reports from 5-15 pages)
6. Consider offering an email course (eg a free 5-day email course)
7. As a general rule, Tue/Wed/Thu between 7-10:30AM works best to send emails (but you should test!)
8. Always send at least plain text, try sending both plain text and HTML
9. Never send attachments
10. Pay attention to your "From" name/address
11. Email subject is the headline - shorter is better, try asking a question or use partial
   statement, or use the recipient's first name
12. Have one goal for each email, perhaps even a CTA (every 4/5th email can be sales-y)
13. Always be testing (opening statistics, CTA conversions, etc...)

The ideal launch looks like this:

1. 6 months before, send traffic to landing page to capture email addresses
2. Over next 6 months, build buzz by guest blogging and sending interesting updates
3. One week before launch, email your list and let them know about special ~48 hour price
4. Launch day, email your list
5. ~36 hours after launch, send final email informing that deal is about to end

# Startup Marketing

There are two tiers of traffic.

1. Tier 1: mailing list, blog/podcast, organic search
2. Tier 2: social media/networks, ads, forums, press releases, guest blogging

You should invest more time in Tier #1, which will provide better targeted traffic. Tier #2 should
still be used, but don't expect too much conversion from it. You can even use Tier #2 to drive
traffic to Tier #1.

A mailing list should be your main focus for marketing. It was covered in the previous chapter.

Next up, consider starting a blog or podcast. Blog readers tend to be more passive but they can
still drive a good marketing punch and helps with search engines. You should write engaging,
original posts that provide value to your readers. Try to convert them to RSS or email subscription.
You should also write for search engines (secondary to human readers of course). Target specific
keywords for each post and do some basic on-site optimizations (headers, long tail research, etc...)

Learn a bit about the SEO game. Don't obsess over it since it's always changing. Be sure to
implement on-page SEO (Rob recommends Search Engine Optimization an Hour a Day). Also do a bit of
work with incoming links. Some general guidelines:

1. Not all links are equal, find high quality websites to get links from
2. Vary the link text
3. Build links over time
4. Stay out of bad neighborhoods

You can build links via:

1. Directories like dmoz.org, joeant.com, or gimpsy.com
2. Niche/local directories (eg search for "design software directory")
3. Use Yahoo! Site Explorer to find where your competitors are getting their backlinks
4. Use Google Alerts on your market/competitor names to find more relevant sources
5. Publishing articles (eg ezinearticles.com, goarticles.com, isnare.com)
6. Offer free academic/non-profit version of product for a link (.edu websites rank well)
7. Contact customers for testimonials
8. Buy links (controversial strategy)

# Virtual Assistants and Outsourcing

In an earlier chapter, you calculated your ideal hourly rate. Now consider the time/money you'll
save with a virtual assistant who you can pay $6/hour.

Ease into virtual assistance with:

1. Task-based VAs ($3-10/hour), via odesk or elance
2. Part-time VAs ($2-7/hour), via odesk or VA services
3. Full-time VAs ($1-5/hour), via VA services

# Grow it or Start Over

After you've launched, you have two choices:

1. Grow it - buckle down, increase sales, and add features
2. Start over - consider the portfolio approach that Rob is taking

Rob uses the term **Micropreneur**. He's a good example of one, he has a portfolio of products -
each one contributing to his income. Once automation is in place for a business, you can launch
another product. The advantage of multiple projects are:

1. Ability to choose small niches (eg you can pick a $500-2000/mo niche because you will be
   launching other products)
2. Income diversification
3. Attention diversification, so you won't get bored
4. Economies of scale, much of the infrastructure you setup for the first product can be re-used
5. Focus on what you enjoy
6. Experience transfers, it will be easier the 2nd/3rd time around

There are also downsides:

1. Task switching hurts
2. Outsourcing and automation are crucial

Here's the formula for micropreneurship:

1. build/buy a product
2. launch/revamp it
3. grow revenue to its natural plateau
4. outsource/automate ruthlessly
5. go to step 1

Some things to consider about micropreneurship:

1. When should you put a product on auto-pilot? Ultimately, it's when you think it hits a plateau.
2. How do you keep maintenance to a minimum? There are 3 areas: support, new features, marketing.

Support can be outsources to virtual assistants. Bug fixing is crucial, but new features might not
be. No product will sell at the same level forever! You may want to consider returning to a product
every 4/8/12 months down the line to add new features. Marketing is the easiest part to automate
using: PPC ads and SEO.

The best advantage of micropreneurship is leveraging your product to live the lifestyle you want.
