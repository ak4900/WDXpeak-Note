### introduction
* pg 2: When overcome with choices, a connoisseur sees differences, while a novice sees similarities.
* pg 8: If comparative diligence proves too taxing, the ability to differentiate dies, as does your ability to compete.
* pg 11: The cadence of competition distracts companies from creating meaningful separation.

### instinct
* pg 27: Comparative metrics capture a brand's personality as seen by customers and relative to competition.
* pg 31: A competitive metric brings out the herd in us; when we measure something, we immediately aspire to it.
* pg 34: Ask customers what they want, and their requests will be driven by what the competition offers.
* pg 37: True or sustainable differentiation is a function of lopsidedness in qualities, not well-roundedness.
* pg 41: Conformity manifests among groups of competitors that are already the most similar to begin with.

### the paradox of progress
* pg 53: Augmentation-by-addition strengthens an existing benefit or adds a new benefit to a product.
* pg 55: Augmentation-by-multiplication yields specialized versions of a product for specific customer segments.
* pg 60: When an ABA becomes standard, customers feel entitled to what they were grateful for yesterday.
* pg 63: When an ABM becomes standard, alternatives grow while the meaningful proportion of them shrinks.
* pg 66: Business has been reduced to the artful packaging of meaningless distinctions as true differentiation.
* pg 70: A hyper-mature category has trickling growth while ABA and ABM is more frenzied than ever.

### the category blur (how we cope)
* pg 75: Online, people reveal who they are by revealing what they consume; it's shorthand for identity.
* pg 79: Passion and comparative expertise in a brand, even if not objective or rational, is ultimate brand loyalty.
* pg 83: In a hyper-mature category, activity is a blur, so we associate with the category, not the brands within.

### escaping the herd
* pg 97: Strong brands change a person's consumption patterns; they create enthusiasts and loyalists.
* pg 99: Differentiated brands render expectations irrelevant in the context of what they are offering.
* pg 102: An "idea brand" offers a jaded, cynical, and bored group something they regard as special.

### reversal
* pg 110: A "reverse-positioned brand" takes away what we expect, but then gives us what we don't.
* pg 114: Reverse brands assume people are "over-satisfied" from the hyper-maturity of the category.
* pg 116: The self-defeating anti-logic of augmentation is that it can actually diminish satisfaction.
* pg 119: If elimination of benefits is thoughtfully executed, the brand's negatives can become personal positives.
* pg 123: Removing the extraneous to shed new light on the fundamental crystalizes the value proposition.
* pg 126: Reverse brands are lopsided; they are under pressure to be well-rounded without diluting their purity.

### breakaway
* pg 135: A breakaway brand offers an alternative category rubric to replace the (sometimes arbitrary) default.
* pg 139: We only buy into the re-categorization if we're ready to move from our current patterns of consumption.
* pg 143: Breakaway brands deviate so much from our stereotypes that they cast doubt on those generalizations.
* pg 145: Alternative category rubrics can invoke alternative but familiar behavioral scripts, so we "get it."
* pg 151: A breakaway brand creates a new subcategory with tremendous first-mover advantage.

### hostility
* pg 163: Traction requires friction, so hostile brands give us chafe; likable products slide off smooth as silk.
* pg 167: Hostile brands are statement brands; they become infused with identity and a host of meanings.
* pg 170: To be a fan of a hostile brand means you are always a customer, never a king; ownership is effortful.
* pg 174: Hostile brands create solidarity, not just divisions; commonalities are magnified among the minority.

### difference
* pg 184: Competition and conformity are linked; a race can only be run if everyone faces the same direction.
* pg 194: Difference can't be concocted using a framework, without context; it depends on what is the norm.

### marketing myopia, revisited
* pg 211: Spending too much time focused on your competitors leads you to copy them as a reflex.
* pg 218: Eliminating skepticism as an option for a few minutes allows improbable ideas to turn into possibilities.
* pg 220: Customers will demand better, but can't tell you how to make products different or that surprise them.
