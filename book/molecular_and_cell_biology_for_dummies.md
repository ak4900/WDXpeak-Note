# Molecular and Cell Biology for Dummies

Rene Fester Kratz, PhD, teaches us microbiology without using jargon. This book was intended to help
2 audiences: students and self-learners. It's organized into 7 parts: intro to the cell, molecules,
working cell, genetics, molecular genetics, tools of molecular biology, and "part of tens".

# Exploring the World of the Cell

Molecular/cellular biology is the study of cell structure/function down to the individual molecules
that make it up. This chapter is an overview of the book. Everything will be explained in greater
detail in later chapters.

Cells are the smallest unit of life. All living things are made up of cells, including us. Besides
the cells that make us up, there are also prokaryotic cells:

* Bacteria - they make us sick but do good things too
* Archaea - just as common but less known, recently discovered

Viruses are not cells. They're smaller than bacteria and our eukaryotic cells. They attack other
cells and are parasitic. Attacked cells may end up reproducing more viruses. Viruses are the cause
of sore throats and HIV.

Cells require a lot of the same things we need:

* eating food or taking in a source of energy for cellular metabolism
* breathing oxygen or cellular respiration for energy
* using food/energy to grow and reproduce

You started life as a single cell, a combination of a sperm/egg. Each of these germ cells donated
half of your genetic information (23 chromosomes each).

The instructions for each cell to work is encoded in DNA. Every cell has a copy of your DNA. They're
constantly reading it to build new molecules like proteins. Proteins are created via transcription
and translation. Signals, like hormones, can tell cells to change behavior. Gene regulation allows
cells to turn off some genes and turn others on.

New technologies have been discovered which allow scientists to extract, read, or modify DNA. New
branches of biology are opening up:

* Bioinformatics - blending computing, biology, and IT to organize/analyze large amounts of
  biological information
* Genomics - study of entire genomes of organisms to learn/discover new proteins and genes
* Proteomics - study of proteins for different cells

# Take a Tour Inside the Cell

All cells fall in one of three groups:

* Eucarya: plants, animals, fungi, and protists
* Bacteria: single-celled microorganisms
* Archaea: single-celled similar to bacteria

Cells of Eucarya are called **eukaryotic**. They have a nucleus containing DNA and organelles.
Bacteria/archaea cells are **prokaryotic**. They don't have a nucleus, their DNA floats within the
cytoplasm. They're typically smaller.

All living things are made up of cells. Some are multicelluar - body is made up of multiple cells.
Others are unicellular.

All cells contain:

* Plasma Membrane or Cytoplasmic Membrane - the boundary of a cell
* Cytoplasm - area inside cell
* DNA or Deoxyribonucleic Acid - plans for how cell is built and how it functions
* Ribosomes - structures where protein is built

The plasma membrane is selectively permeable and have proteins on it. The proteins consist of
receptors, which detect signals in the cell's environment, and transport proteins.

The cytoplasm is crowded. Most of the metabolism of a cell occurs here, including the production of
proteins. The organelles move around in here.

In eukaryotic cells, DNA is separated from the cytoplasm via the nucleus. For prokaryotic cells, DNA
is in the cytoplasm area called nucleoid.

Ribosomes are the workbenches where proteins are made. They're made up of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and
proteins.

The nucleus contains the cell's DNA, which is the instructions for the cell. The boundary is called
a nuclear envelope. DNA is in the form of chromosomes or chromatin (wounded up vs unwounded
spaghetti-ish). The cell reads the DNA and builds ribosomal subunits in the nucleoli area of the
nucleus and then ships it out to the cytoplasm.

Molecules enter in/leave the nucleus via nuclear pores. This includes:

* RNA molecules and ribosomal subunits
* proteins
* nucleotides - building blocks of DNA and RNA

The endomembrane system is the post office of the cell - it builds proteins and lipids then ships
them off. There are a few components:

The endoplasmic reticulum is a component that starts at the nucleus and comes in two types: rough
endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The rough one has attached ribosomes used to
deliver protein to a special destination.

The Golgi apparatus will tag proteins before shipping them off. The middle of the ER is called a
lumen.

Vesicles transport things around the cells. Transport vesicles carry molecules, lysosomes dispose of
garbage, secretory vesicles bring materials to the plasma membrane.

Peroxisomes help break down lipids. This ends the endomembrane system...

The mitochondrion is the fireplace where cells burn their food via cellular respiration.
Mitochondria are the power plants of the cell which transfer energy from food to ATP (stored energy
for the cell).

Chloroplasts make food molecules via photosynthesis and are only found in plant cells.

The structure of the cell is supported by the cytoskeleton - kind of a scaffold which holds the cell
together. They run though the cell providing a network for vesicles/organelles to travel. Cells
flick with cilia and eukaryotic flagella to move about. Cytoskeletal proteins come in three groups:

* Microfilaments - make muscle cells contract and act as railroad tracks to a cell's organelles
* Microtubules - protein inside cilia and flagella
* Intermediate Filaments - reinforcing proteins for cells

The plasma membrane provides a selective boundary for the cell. Most cells have additional layers
outside of it. The layer around the animal cell is called the extracellular matrix.

# Dead or Alive: Viruses

**Viruses** are microscopic particles of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) and protein that attack cells and
turn them into virus factories. They're responsible for significant diseases: measles, influenza,
polio, and AIDS.

Whereas bacteria are living cells, viruses are not. They cannot do anything without hijacking a
cell. Scientists don't consider viruses to be alive.

The simplest viruses have two components: a **nucleic acid core** and a **protein capsid**. The DNA
or RNA contains instructions for taking over cells to produce more virions (viral particles) and the
capsid is an outer shell.

Some viruses also have an outer envelope that they steal from the cell's membrane. They might also
have proteins that stick out called **spikes**, which help attach them to cells.

Viruses come in three shapes:

* helical - form of twisting helix around nucleic acid core
* polyhedral - regular geometric shape
* complex - separate patches of protein forming unique structures

Viruses attach to cells if they have the right viral protein that's accepted by the cell's
receptors. They then dig a hole through the cell wall, slip in by fusing with the cell membrane, or
trick the cell into bringing it inside. **Host range** is used to denote the type of cells a virus
can infect.

**Bacteriophage** (phage = eat, so bacteria eater) are a type of virus which attack bacteria. In the
lytic cycle, bacteriophage will use the cell to create more phage and destroy it. In the lysogenic
cycle, bacteriophage will enter during a dormant stage. The host cell will reproduce - creating
cells which are infected.

Example steps of the lytic cycle:

1. Attachment - proteins of virus attach to receptors of bacteria
2. Penetration - genetic material of virus enters
3. Biosynthesis - virus uses host cell's nucleotides/amino acids to make more viral parts. ATP from
   host cell supplies energy
4. Maturation - viral particles assemble into new virus
5. Release - virus leaves host cell, lysing or destroying as they leave

Bacteriophage that enter the lysogenic cycle remain inactive/dormant in the bacteria for a while.
During this time, their DNA is integrated with the host cell's DNA (now called **prophage**). The
steps are then: attachment, penetration, recombination, replication. Environmental signals will
trigger the virus to go into lytic cycle.

Viruses that attack eukaryotic cells are the same, but some terms are different:

* Latent instead of lysogenic
* Provirus instead of prophage
* Acute disease instead of lytic cycle

After an enveloped virus attaches to its eukaryotic host cell, it enters via one of two ways:

* Fusion - envelope of virus fuses with host cell's membrane, like two soap bubbles merging together
* Receptor-mediated endocytosis - the host cell is tricked, wraps the virus in a vesicle and brings
  it in

After entering, the virus removes its capsid (called **uncoating**) and releases its genetic
material into the host cell. Viruses have different reproductive strategies which are dependent on
the class of virus:

* Double-stranded DNA viruses: ie smallpox, inserts its genetic material into the host's nucleus. It
  gets copied whenever the host divides
* Retroviruses: ie HIV, single stranded RNA enters the host cell and reverse transcribes a double
  stranded DNA to insert into the nucleus
* Double-stranded RNA viruses: introduces their RNA into the cytoplasm to make viral proteins
* Single-stranded RNA viruses: negative-sense or positive-sense. Negative like influenza, insert
  their RNA into cytoplasm to create new RNA and make proteins. Positive insert their RNA directly,
  doesn't need to create new RNA.

Viruses may use their own enzymes or host enzymes to copy genetic material. Viral enzymes make more
mistakes in host enzymes, causing mutations in viruses. The variation makes it harder to defeat.

After the genetic material is copied, the viruses leave the host cell. Sometimes they leave via
**budding**, pushing up against the membrane and taking a chunk of it while leaving. This helps
disguise them as cells.

Putting it all together, the steps are: attachment, penetration, uncoating, biosynthesis,
maturation, release.

# Better Living Through Chemistry

Organisms are made of cells. Cells are made of molecules. Molecules are made of atoms. Atoms are
made of subatomic particles.

Subatomic particles are protons (positive charge), electrons (negative charge), and neutrons (no
charge). The nucleus of an atom is made of protons/neutrons and the electrons orbit it. The number
of protons determine what element an atom is. It's called the **atomic number**.

An **isotope** has different numbers of neutrons than protons. Carbon usually has 6
protons/neutrons. Carbon-5 is an isotope variation that has 5 neutrons.

Periodic tables often include the **atomic mass** of elements, which is the average mass in atomic
mass units of all atoms on earth for each element. It's the number of protons plus the number of
neutrons.

Atoms form larger structures called **molecules** via chemical bonds. This will happen via:

1. Atoms share an electron to form a more stable structure
2. There is an attraction between opposite electrical charges

Each element has an electron configuration, which is useful in determining how stable that element
is. Noble gases have an outer shell full of electrons, so they're pretty stable. **Valence
electrons** are the electrons in the outermost energy levels. They're the electrons which are
usually given/shared.

The **Periodic Table** will tell you how many valence electrons an element has. Most atoms follow
the octet rule, most of them want 8 electrons in its outer shell. Elements on the left side tend to
want to give away electrons. Elements on the right side really want more electrons. The tendency for
an atom to attract electrons is called **electronegativity**.

If one atom takes an electron, an **oxidation reduction reaction** or **redox reaction** has
occurred. The atom giving up an electron was **oxidized** and the atom gaining an electron was
**reduced** (think in term of charges).

For more information on electron configuration and chemical bonds, see notes on Khan Academy's
Chemistry lectures.

Whereas an isotope had differing numbers of neutrons, **ions** have different number of electrons
causing a charge. **Ionic bonds** form due to electrical attractions from opposite charges. They're
strong in solid form, but weak in liquid form and in water.

**Covalent bonds** occur when atoms share an electron. Two oxygen elements are equally
electronegative and they both benefit by sharing two electrons by becoming more stable (rule of
eights).

In a **polar covalent bond**, the electron spends more time orbiting the nucleus of the more
electronegative atom. After polar covalent bonds form, they setup the formation of **hydrogen
bonds**. Hydrogen bonds are weak electrical forces between opposite ends of polar bonds. They're
like velcro. Hydrogen bonds hold the two helixes of your DNA together.

**Hydrophobic molecules** don't mix well with water. Water has many polar and hydrogen bonds. When a
molecule with polar bond is mixed in, it dissolves well. When a covalent bonded molecule is mixed
in, it's rejected - like water/oil.

Your body is 60-75% water. Water is essential to living things:

* Water is a solvent. Ions and polar molecules dissolve in water. Water prevents them from forming
  solids. All chemical reactions in cells occur in water.
* Water helps moves things across membranes.
* Water causes hydrophobic interactions.
* Water helps maintain the structure of important molecules.

Water molecules reach a equilibrium where H(2)O splits and forms hydrogen and hydroxide ion:

    H(2)O <--> H^+ + OH^-

The concentration of hydrogen ions is measured in pH (-log of the molarity). The concentration of
hydroxide ions is measured in pOH. A pH of 7 is neutral on the acid/base scale.

Cells can only survive within a narrow range of pH - they prefer neutral. Some chemicals can add
hydrogen ions and increase the pH of water. These are acids. Chemicals that remove hydrogen ions are
bases.

Cells employ **buffers** to maintain the pH of water. These buffers can release hydrogen ions in a
solution or remove them. Your blood has the acid/base pair of carbonic acid and bicarbonate to
maintain your blood pH.

Cells often recycle and rebuild structures using existing molecules. When a structure is no longer
needed, cells will break it apart to form a new one from the pieces (different shape and recombining
with different atoms).

There are four groups of macromolecules (big molecules) important to the cell: carbohydrates,
proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. All of them but lipids are made up of the same repeating type
of building block. A long repetitive molecule is called a **polymer**. The building block of a
polymer is a **monomer**.

Whenever a monomer is added to the polymer, a water molecules formed. The reaction is called
**condensation or dehydration synthesis**. Polymers can be broken down into individual monomers via
**hydrolysis** - a water molecule is inserted into the bond between two monomers to break it apart.

Remember hydro means water and lysis means breaking (as in when a virus lyces from the cell - breaks
out of).

# Carbohydrates: How Sweet They Are

Carbohydrates are made of carbons, hydrogen, and oxygen in the ratio of:

    CH(2)O

They're divided into two groups: monosaccharides and polysaccharides. They're also known as simple
sugars and complex carbohydrates.

Monosaccharides have a backbone of 3-7 carbons and are called trioses, tetroses, pentoses, hexoses,
and heptoses. They have Hydroxyl groups (OH) attached to every carbon but one which make up sugars
polar (and dissolves in water).

They have one double-bonded oxygen attached to the carbon backbone called a carbonyl group. If it's
at the end, the sugar is an aldose. If it's within the backbone, it's a ketose. It's not just the
number of atoms which determine what kind of simple sugar it is - the structure is important too.

Polysaccharides are multiple monosaccharides joined together by condensation reactions (removal of
water). The bonds between them are glycosidic linkages. They're classified by how many
monosaccharides there are: disaccharides like lactose, oligosaccharides (short chains), or
polysaccharides (long chains).

Carbohydrates are an important source of energy for cells. They provide structural molecules for
cells like the walls. Cells are marked with glycoproteins (proteins with sugar) to identify them.
They make a sticky matrix around cells to help bacteria stick.

# Proteins: Workers in the Cellular Factory

Most jobs in the cell are done by proteins. The shape of a protein is essential for its job. They
control metabolism, transport, communication, structure, division, and more. They can specifically
target a particular molecule or process.

Proteins start as polymers of **amino acids**, also called a **polypeptide**. Once that folds and
becomes functional, it's a protein. Some protein are made of multiple polypeptides.

If a protein **denatures** (unfolds), it can no longer function. Protein structure or
**conformation** is organized into 4 categories:

* Primary structure - sequence of amino acids
* Secondary structure - small areas folded into alpha helices and pleated sheets
* Tertiary structure - final 3D shape of one folded amino acid chain
* Quarternary structure - found in proteins consisting multiple folded chains

The cell contains 20 variants of amino acids. The choice and ordering of these amino acids makes up
the primary structure of a protein. Each amino acid has the same structure, a central carbon atom is
bonded to 4 different chemicals:

* a nitrogen-containing amino group (-NH(2) or NH(3)+)
* a carboxyl group (-COOH or -COO-)
* a hydrogen atom (-H)
* A side chain (-R) that varies between the 20 amino acids

The N-C-C backbone pattern is useful in identifying amino acids. You can use it to distinguish
proteins/carbohydrates. The bonds between amino acids are **peptide bonds** and are covalent formed
via condensation.

The folded patterns/areas of a protein make up the secondary structure. There are two possible fold
patterns:

* Alpha helix - similar to a smooth spiral
* Pleated sheets - sharp turns/twist in the opposite direction

Some proteins only have the alpha helix, some only have pleated sheets, some have both. They're held
together with hydrogen bonds in the nitrogen/hydrogen atoms and carbon/oxygen atoms.

The tertiary structure is the final 3D shape of the protein. There are also two categories:

* Globular proteins: have an overall rounded or irregular shape
* Fibrous proteins: are long and cable-like

The tertiary structure is held together with various bonds in the R groups:

* Covalent bonds: the amino acid cysteine has a sulfhydrl group (-SH) in its R group. When two are
  next to each other, they form a disulfide bridge which is covalent and strong. It doesn't break
  when protein denatures.
* Ionic bonds: some R groups ionize in water and form ionic bonds. They're weak in watery solution
  and will be lost if the protein denatures.
* Hydrogen bonds: if a polar covalent bond forms, so do hydrogen bonds which are weak and will be
  lost if the protein denatures.
* Hydrophobic interactions: some R groups are hydrophobic. Water will push them together to form a
  bond. These are weak and will also be lost if the protein denatures.

Some proteins will start to function as soon as they form their tertiary structure. Others require a
quarternary structure. These are large and complex. They form multiple polypeptide chains. The bonds
that hold the polypeptides together are the same bonds holding tertiary structures together, but
only with the R groups. The hemogoblin protein in your blood is quarternary.

Proteins carry out many tasks:

* they're enzymes
* they reinforce structure like the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix
* they transport materials in/out of the cell in the plasma membrane
* they identify cells with glycoproteins on the membrane
* they help cells move (flagella)
* they help communicate via receptors or insulin
* they organize molecules. Chaperone proteins help other amino acids fold into proteins.
* they defend the body against bacteria/viruses (antibodies)
* they regulate which parts of the DNA is used

# DNA and RNA: Instructions for Life

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are both polymers of nucleotides. DNA
specifies which proteins and RNA to construct.

Nucleotides have 3 different components and make up nucleic acids. Nucleic acids can be single or
double-stranded. Chained together, they're called polynucleotide chains. The components of
nucleotides are:

* A pentose (5-carbon) sugar - deoxyribose or ribose
* A nitrogenous base
* A phosphate group - a phosphorous atom surrounded by oxygen atoms

To navigate the nucleotides the carbon atoms are numbered from 1 to 5. They're also marked as prime:
1', 2', 3', 4', 5' to denote the difference between the sugar carbons and nitrogenous base carbons.
The first carbon (1') is attached to the nitrogenous base. Numbers increase as we move away.

The pentose is different for DNA and RNA. DNA has deoxyribose as its sugar whereas RNA has ribose -
the difference is just one oxygen atom. Ribose has a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to its 2' carbon
while deoxyribose only has a hydrogen (-H). Nucleotides are either ribonucleotide or
deoxyribonucleotide. DNA is double stranded while RNA is single stranded.

There are five different nitrogenous bases found in nucleotides:

* Adenine (A)
* Guanine (G)
* Cytosine (C)
* Thymine (T) - only in DNA
* Uracil (U) - only in RNA

These bases fall into two groups. Pyrimidines with a single ring structure and two nitrogen atoms
within the ring. Purines have two fused rings with two nitrogen atoms in each ring. Cytosine,
thymine, and uracil are pyrimidines. Adenine and guanine are purines.

Polynucleotide chains give DNA its second structure: a double helix. The sides of the ladder are
made of the sugar phosphate backbone. The rungs are made of nitrogenous base pairs with hydrogen
bonds. The sides are antiparallel, if one side has its 5' carbon pointing up - the other has it
pointing down.

Adenine forms hydrogen bonds with thymine. Cytosine forms hydrogen bonds with guanine. The
complementary base pairs are A=T, C=G.

For RNA, it's A=U. RNA can also have a 3d secondary structure. They fold upon themselves into
complex shapes.

Our genetic code is encoded in those base pairs (A, T, C, and G). Cells decode DNA for many tasks:

* Protein structure: determined via transcription/translation. Code in DNA is copied and used to
  specify amino acids sequence
* RNA structure: through the process of transcription
* Messenger RNA (mRNA): goes from DNA to ribosomes to produce proteins
* Transfer RNA (tRNA): decodes message from mRNA to match amino acids
* Ribosomal RNA (rRNA): part of the structure of the ribosome

# Lipids: Waterproof and Energy Rich

**Lipids** are molecules that don't mix well with water. Some lipids made by cells include: fats,
phospholipids, waxes, cholesterol, steroids, and sterols.

**Hydrocarbons** are molecules that have long chains of carbon atom bonded to hydrogen atoms. Lipids
are hydrophobic because they contain non-polar covalent bonds between carbon/hydrogen.

They're more diverse than the other three macromolecules (carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic
acids). They're not polymers. Their subcategories:

* Fats and oils: made of fatty acids attached to glycerol backbone
* Phospholipids: same as above but with unique hydrophilic group
* Waxes: fatty acids attached to long-chain alcohols
* Sterols: contain four fused carbon rings

**Fatty acids** are long chains of carbon and hydrogen. Their 2 categories:

* Saturated fats: carbon atoms bonded with single bonds. Carbon has 4 available bonds - this leaves
  2 for hydrogens.
* Unsaturated fats: carbon atoms bonded with more double bonds. These carbons can only bond with 1
  hydrogen atom.

When three fatty acids join a glycerol backbone (three-carbon alcohol with attached hydroxyl
radicals) it's called **triglycerides**.

When you're trying to recognize lipid molecules, just remember that they're hydrocarbons - they have
chains of hydrogen/carbon molecules.

Triglycerides with high levels of saturated fat are called fats, while those with unsaturated bonds
are oils. Fats are solid at room temp because the bonds are more organized. Oils are liquid at room
temp due to unsaturated bonds.

**Phospholipids** are similar to triglycerides but only have two fatty acid tails.

Lipids pack a lot of energy into a small space due to the carbon/hydrogen bonds. They have 9
calories per gram while protein and carbohydrates only have 5 calories per gram. Energy storage is
the major function of lipids in cells.

Besides energy storage, lipids are also important for:

* insulation
* structure of plasma membranes
* water-proofing
* signaling - ie steroid hormones trigger changes in human development

# Hello Neighbor, How Cells Communicate

The plasma membrane of the cell is **selectively permeable** - molecules can only pass through it
the membrane allows it. The major factors determining if a molecule can/cannot pass:

* size: smaller molecules pass through easier
* attraction to water: hydrophobic molecules cross easier than hydrophilic. There's a hydrophobic
  interior of the phosopholipid bilayer. Hydrophilic molecules require help from proteins to pass.

Transport proteins help control what can enter/exit a cell. Most molecules are too large or too
attracted to water. They can't cross without the help of the transport proteins.

Molecules will evenly distribute between the interior/exterior of the cell. **Diffusion** is the
movement of molecules from higher concentration to lower concentration to create an equilibrium.
It's called simple diffusion without the help of transport proteins. It's called facilitated
diffusion with help.

There are two types of transport proteins that facilitate diffusion:

* Channel proteins: they're like soda straws. Polypeptide chains build straw walls and create an
  open tunnel down the middle of the protein. They form tunnels through the membrane filled with
  water for molecules to pass through. Some are always open. Gated channels open/close in response
  to signals.
* Carrier proteins: Each carrier protein has a binding site made for a specific molecule type. When
  it's binded, it changes shape and moves across.

Water also diffuses - it's called **osmosis**. It's passive and requires no energy from the cell.
Greater concentrations of water mean pure water and less solutes.

* Hypertonic - solutions have a greater concentration of solutes
* Hypotonic - solutions have a lesser concentration of solutes
* Isotonic - solutions have equal concentration of solutes

Cells need to move molecules from where they're less concentrated to where they're more concentrated
- going against the flow. They do this via **active transport**. It requires energy from the cell,
usually ATP. For example, carrier proteins change shapes using ATP from cells to carry molecules
inside. These active transport carrier proteins are called **pumps**.

Multicellular organisms are made of a community of cells and it's important for them to communicate,
act distributed, request/respond. **Attachment** of cells form tissues. **Communication** allows
cells to coordinate signals/responses.

There are many types of attachments:

* tight junctions: so tight that water cannot pass through. Proteins pass through membranes of both
  cells. Important for tissue like skin so foreign molecules cannot pass through.
* anchoring junctions: hold cells tightly but allow molecules to pass through the space in between.
  Important for tissue with structure but requires demanding work like heart tissue.

Anchoring junctions have subtypes:

* desmosomes: use cadherins in the membrane of both cells. Cadherins proteins also with intermediate
  filaments in the cytoplasm of cells
* hemidesmosomes: anchor cells to extracellular matrix using integrins proteins.
* adherens junctions: anchor cells to each other and extracellular matrix

Between cells in almost all animal tissue are **gap junctions** formed by connexins proteins. They
form rings on cell membranes called **pores**. Two cells may align the pores and form tunnels
between each cell for ion and small molecules to pass through. Plant cells have similar tunnels
called **plasmodesmata**.

Signals from one cell will trigger a response in another far away - the signals are called
**hormones**. The hormone insulin is produced by pancreas cells to tell blood cells to take glucose
out of the blood as a food source.

A cell can recognize signals only if it has a **receptor** for it. Kind of like the observer
pattern. They've got receptors in two locations: inside the cells for signaling molecules which can
cross the membrane, in the plasma membrane for other molecules.

Receptor proteins have binding sites for signals. When ligands - signaling molecules - bind to these
proteins, they change shape and set off a series of events in the cell. This process is called
**signal transduction**.

A signal may be amplified via a **signal transduction pathway**. This is similar to the series of
chain reactions of signal transduction. They main difference is the pathway can activate many
secondary messengers at once.

Deactivating a signal happens when the primary messenger stops sending it. Some molecules in the
cell are used to shut the messenger down: phosphatases, activated G proteins, Ras proteins, and
second messenger molecules.

# Metabolism: Transferring Energy and Matter

Cells constantly convert energy/matter into different forms to get what they need. They store energy
in food molecules and break it down to get it out.

**Metabolism** is all of a cell's chemical reactions - like breaking down food molecules or building
muscle proteins. Your body breaks down food and converts it into molecules you need. **Catabolism**
are reactions breaking larger molecules into smaller one. **Anabolism** is the opposite.

Let's review thermodynamics. **Work** is moving something over a distance. **Energy** is something
you need to do work. The first two laws are important for molecular biology:

* Energy can't be created or destroyed
* Chemical reactions that occur spontaneously increase entropy (disorder) of an isolated system

Energy can be organized into **potential** or **kinetic** - from an object's position/arrangement or
energy from motion of molecules.

In cellular biology, spontaneous reactions are those that occur on their own without the need for
energy. An example of this is diffusion, which follows the second law. Particles will flow from a
concentrated area to less concentrated without energy - because it increases the disorder.

Cells maintain their order by constantly using their stored energy to do nonspontaneous reactions.

Kratz gives us a brick wall/pile analogy. The brick pile is disorder and spontaneous. A brick wall
is organized and requires work and energy. Over time, the brick wall will become a pile of brick
unless energy is used to maintain it. Reactions that build large, complex molecules require energy.
Reactions that break down to smaller molecules outputs energy.

**Exergonic** reactions release energy. **Endergonic** reactions absorbs it.

You can determine if a chemical reaction is spontaneous or nonspontaneous by looking at the changes
in **free energy**. Gibbs free energy (G) is used to measure entropy/heat in a reaction. A negative
free energy (nG or deltaG) is a spontaneous reaction:

    nG = G products - G reactants

Some of the work cells do:

* synthesis: build large/complex/structured molecules like DNA, proteins, membranes, or ribosomes
* organization: eukaryotic cells create compartments
* creation of electrochemical gradients: cells organize ions to cause differences in electrical
  charge which helps other reactions
* transport and movement

Cells break down food molecules for energy. They use adenosine triphosphate, better known as
**ATP**:

1. Energy from food is transferred to ATP
2. ATP provides energy for cellular work

ATP is a nucleotide with the same building blocks as DNA/RNA: sugar ribose, nitrogenous base, three
phosphate groups. Cells continually build/break down ATP in ATP/ADP cycles. They store energy by
building ATP out of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate groups. They obtain energy by breaking
ATP back into those components (breaking it down requires water).

Metabolic changes are broken down into small steps, each a chemical reaction. Several reactions in a
series make up a **metabolic pathway**. Enzymes speed up chemical reactions by lowering the energy
of activation. Electrons are transferred between molecules during metabolic reactions. Energy is
also transferred during metabolic reactions.

Chemical reactions usually happen in many small steps instead of one quick change so cells can
control energy changes:

    A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F

The starting molecule A is called the **substrate**. The ending molecule F is the **product**. B, C,
D, E are called **intermediates**.

Spontaneous reactions are just waiting to occur. All they need is the right molecules to collide
with just enough kinetic energy. To initialize it, the amount of energy needed to trigger is called
**energy of activation (Ea)**.

**Enzymes** lower the energy of activation, making it easier/quicker for reactions to occur. Every
cell reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme. Enzymes are very specific for substrates. In the formula
above (A->F), five enzymes are used - one for each reaction.

**Productive collisions** are those with enough energy of activation for the reaction to occur.
Reactants must: collide, be oriented correctly, and have enough kinetic energy to overcome energy of
activation.

Enzymes will bind substrates in their active sites and move them into the correct orientation. They
can alter chemical bonds making reactions more likely.

Electrons are usually transferred during metabolic reactions. **Oxidation** is when a molecule gives
up an electron. **Reduction** is when a molecule gains an electron (reduced in charge).

Metabolism is all about getting what you need:

* building blocks for growth/repair
* energy for cellular work
* reducing power

# Cellular Respiration: Every Breath You Take

## Overview

When you eat food, your digestive system breaks it down into small molecules. Your cells break it
down further for energy. The metabolic pathway to break food or capture stored energy for cells is
called **cellular respiration**. It breaks down 3 of the important macromolecules: carbohydrates,
proteins, and fats.

1. During respiration, electrons are removed from food molecules and transferred to an electron
   carrier NADH, then to oxygen (O2)
2. At the end, the energy from the food is transferred to ATP
3. Through chemical reactions, food is rearranged to waste products - carbon dioxide and water

Glucose is the starting point:

    C(6)H(12)O(6) + 6O(2) -> 6CO(2) + 6H(2)O + energy  # ignores intermediaries

Burning a marshmallow or paper shows the stored energy. You're converting the sugars into carbon
dioxide and water. The energy becomes heat and light.

During respiration, glucose is oxidized and oxygen is reduced. When this electron is moved, it's
part of a hydrogen atom. The products are in a more stable state - so it's an exergonic reaction.
The energy gets transferred to ATP, a storable form.

Cells actually go through many steps for this reaction. Here's a rough overview:

1. Glycolysis - oxidation of glucose begins, electrons transferred to NAD+. Small amount of energy
   transferred to ATP. Occurs in cytoplasm.
2. Krebs Cycle - continues oxidation of intermediaries resulting in CO(2). Occurs in the
   mitochondrion of the cell.
3. Oxidative Phosphorylation (Electron Transport Chain) - transfers electrons from carriers to
   electron transport chain. Reduction of oxygen to produce water. Also occurs in mitochondrion of
   cell.

## Glycolysis

Glycolysis is a series of chemical reactions resulting in:

* oxidation of glucose
* transfer of small amount of energy to ATP
* transfer of electrons to carrier NAD+

The major events are:

1. Bonds in glucose break and reform creating two molecules of pyruvate
2. Enzymes transfer energy from ATP to intermediaries as the energy investment phase. Then more
   energy gets transferred back as the energy payoff phase. For every molecule of glucose, 2 ATPs
   used and 4 comes back.
3. Enzymes oxidize glucose and reduce NAD+ -> NADH+H+

Some cells rely on glycolysis without the krebs cycle and electron transport chain. They usually
have a 2nd fermentation step to recycle the NADH. Lactic acid fermentation occurs if the hydrogen
atoms is transferred to pyruvate, causing the NADH to become NAD again. Alcohol fermentation removes
a carbon and two oxygens from pyruvate and releases CO(2), resulting in acetaldehyde - which the
NADH gives its hydrogen to. Reduced acetaldehyde is ethanol (or alcohol).

## Krebs Cycle

The krebs cycle picks up after glycolysis, continues to oxidize the intermediates, and transfers
energy.

The major events are:

1. Enzymes oxidize intermediates and reduce electron carriers
2. Enzymes break bonds and rearrange atoms in intermediates, removing carbon and oxygen atoms and
   releasing them as CO(2)
3. Enzymes transfer energy to ATP

This produces a total of 2 ATPs per glucose.

## Oxidative Phosphorylation (Electron Transport Chain)

Chemiosmotic theory of oxidative phosphorylation - a big name to explain how energy and electrons
from food help make ATP. By the end of glycolysis a cell hasn't made much ATP but has made many
reduced electron carriers: NADH+H+ and FADH(2). These molecules can cash those electrons to make
ATP.

**Electron transport chains** are made of large protein complexes embedded in a membrane. They
accept electrons and pass them from complex to complex. They have an enzyme called ATP synthase.
During oxidative phosphorylation, protons enter a small channel in ATP synthase and exits on the
matrix side. The synthase has binding sites for ADP and P. Every three molecules provides enough
energy for the synthesis of one ATP from ADP and P.

The most electronegative molecule in the electron transport chain is O(2). The proton ends up there,
which is why H(2)O is a waste product of respiration.

## Breaking Complex Carbs, Proteins, and Fats

Food molecules besides glucose need to change into intermediates in glycolysis or the Krebs cycle
before being oxidized.

Of all the food molecules, carbohydrates are the easiest to digest because many of the intermediates
in glycolysis are carbohydrates. Simple sugars, like glucose, don't need an extra step. Complex
carbs are just polymers of simple sugars, so it's also easy to break down.

Enzymes called lipases break fats/oils down into glycerol and fatty acids. These two are then fed to
cellular respiration. Glycerol is a 3-carbon compound that's an intermediate to glycolysis. Fatty
acids are broken into 2-carbon fragments, then acetyl-CoA - an intermediate of the Krebs cycle.

Proteins require the most work. They're polymers, so they get broken down into their building
blocks. Then enzymes make major alterations to the amino acids so they become intermediates to
glycolysis or the Krebs cycle.

## Anabolism (building new molecules) in Respiration

Cellular respiration must break down many molecules before building new ones. It's a two way street.
Catabolism breaks down food molecules, but anabolism builds new molecules from the intermediates.

If a cell needs to build a macromolecule, the intermediates can be used from cellular respiration to
build it.

## In the Real World

We all know "eat less, exercise more" leads to losing weight. This is partly due to cellular
respiration.

Exercising causes cells to use more ATP and increase the amount of ADP. ADP stimulates enzymes in
cellular respiration, triggering an increase in the breakdown of food molecules.

If you combine this with the decreased food, cells will have to use the currently stored food
molecules to fuel respiration. They turn to stored fat.

# Photosynthesis: Makin' Food in the Kitchen of Life

## Overview

Plants, algae, and some bacteria do photosynthesis. Photosynthesis uses energy from the sun, matter
from CO(2), H(2)O to form carbohydrates. With these carbohydrates and some minerals, living things
can build all the molecules needed for life: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids.

Photosynthesis summarized is this chemical reaction:

    6CO(2) + 6H(2)O + light energy -> C(6)H(12)O(6) + 6O(2)

Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms rearrange to form glucose and oxygen. The reactants come from the
air and soil. The products end up in the plant body (sugars) or waste back into the atmosphere
(oxygen).

Light energy from the sun becomes chemical energy stored in the bonds of sugar.

## What Plants Need

Plants are **autotrophs**, meaning self-feeding, they can make their own food. Plant structures are
specialized to take in materials:

* Roots take water from the soil
* Xylem, tubes of cells for water transport, moves water from roots throughout the plant
* Phloem, tubes of cells for sugar transport, moves sugars from green leaves to the rest of the
  plant
* Stomates, pores on leaves, let carbon dioxide into leaves
* Chlorophyll, green pigment on leaves, absorb light

Plants don't need the soil. It's useful for them to stand in and get water from. Also, minerals from
the soil sometime help with metabolism - but they're not necessary.

They just need the sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.

Plants capture the electromagnetic radiation within the visible light band from the sun for
photosynthesis.

## Calvin Cycle and Light Reaction

Photosynthesis is made up of multiple small reactions.

In light reactions, plants capture light energy from the sun and transform it into chemical energy
in the form of ATP. They also take electrons from H(2)O and transfer them to electron carrier NADPH.

In the Calvin cycle, plants capture CO(2) and convert it into carbohydrates. To do this conversion,
they need the ATP and NADPH's electrons from the light reactions.

## Photosynthesis in the Real World

Carbohydrates made by plants, algae, and bacteria serve as the food for all life on Earth. Plants
are on the bottom of every food chain. Autotrophs make their own food, heterotrophs eat autotrophs:

    Sun -> Grass -> Cow -> Human

You can see how the energy from the sun eventually makes its way to you.

# Splitsville: The Cell Cycle and Cell Division

## Overview

Eukaryote division is a little more complicated than prokaryote division. This chapter goes over the
steps of a cell cycle and cell division.

All cells come from pre-existing cells. They divide for:

* Growth - most living things started as a single cell (zygote). That single cell kept dividing to
  grow into you
* Repair - if a multicellular organism is wounded, cells surrounding the wound will reproduce to
  repair the tissue
* Reproduction - single cell organisms reproduce by making clones

## Bacteria & Binary Fission

Bacteria uses a simple process of copying their cells called **binary fission**:

1. Bacterial cell makes a copy of its chromosomes
2. The cell gets larger as it makes copies of ribosomes and molecules in the cytoplasm
3. New plasma membrane and a cell wall are built to divide the cell in two

Some bacteria can finish this in two minutes. That's one to a thousand cells in less than 2 hours.

## Cell Cycle

Some cells divide all the time, like cells on the skin and mucous membrane. They're constantly being
shed from the body and need to be replaced.

Some cells divide when signaled, like liver cells which only divide if the liver has been damaged.

Some cells don't usually divide, like cells in nervous tissue. That's why nerve damage cannot be
repaired.

The dividing phase of eukaryotic cells is called **mitosis**. The nondividing phase is called
**interphase** which is made up of three subphases: G1, S, and G2. The alternating cycle of
mitosis/interphase is the **cell cycle**.

Cells spend most of their time in interphase G1 (Gap 1). They're active and functioning. Mature
cells that don't divide stay in G0. In order to get to the next phase for division, cells must pass
a checkpoint. If they fail, they commit cell suicide - **apoptosis**. The checks are:

* Signals that tell cell to divide
* Must have plenty of nutrients
* DNA must be in good condition
* Must be large enough to divide

At S (synthesize) phase, cells copy their DNA via DNA replication. After the DNA is copied, cells
proceed to G2 (Gap 2). At G2, cells check the work they did during S as another checkpoint:

* The DNA can't be damaged
* Cell copied all chromosomes
* Signals tell cell to proceed into mitosis

If all checks are valid, the cell goes into mitosis.

## Chromosomes & Mitosis

At this stage, cells have duplicated DNAs and are ready to divide into two. Each cell needs a
complete set with one of every chromosome.

You have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) in each cell of your body. During S phase, they're duplicated.
Each one has an identical copy (sister chromatid) that remains attached at the centromere - forming
an X shape.

The **mitotic spindle** is a cell structure responsible for separating the chromatid pairs. They're
made of microtubules which are cytoskeletal proteins.

Mitosis consists of four phases:

* Prophase - chromosomes coil up (condense), nuclear membrane breaks down so the mitotic spindle can
  reach into the center, mitotic spindle attaches to the chromosomes, nucleoli break down
* Metaphase - cells organize chromosomes by lining them up in the middle of the mitotic spindle.
  There's a metaphase checkpoint to make sure it's attached.
* Anaphase - replicated chromosomes separate and each sister chromatid goes to opposite sides of the
  cell
* Telophase - reverses the events of prophase. Chromosomes uncoil, nuclear membrane reforms, mitotic
  spindle brakes down, nucleoli reforms

## Cytokinesis

After the chromosomes separate and nuclear membrane reforms, the cytoplasm separates and forms two
distinct cells. The separation of cytoplasm is called **cytokinesis**.

# Meiosis: Getting Ready for Baby

## Overview

Organisms that reproduce sexually produce eggs and sperms that join to make a new individual. Eggs
and sperm are sex cells or germ cells. To produce them, cells need to go through a special dividing
process called **Meiosis**.

Body cells called **somatic cells** have twice the genetic information of the **gamete cells**
(eggs/sperm). Somatic cells produce gametes via meiosis.

The life cycle is:

1. Somatic cells undergo meiosis to produce gamete cells
2. Sperm and eggs join to create the first cell called a **zygote**
3. Zygote divides to form a multicellular organism

## Chromosomes

Gametes have half the number of chromosomes as somatic cells. One complete set of chromosomes is
called the **haploid number** and is usually represented with the letter N. Two complete sets are 2N
or **diploid number**. Humans have 23 pairs - so our haploid number is 23. Gamete cells are haploid,
whereas zygotes are diploid.

Cells have matching pairs of chromosomes called **homologous chromosomes**. Each human gamete
contributes one set of 23 chromosomes.

Scientists can differentiate chromosomes based on a few characteristics:

* Chromosome length
* Position of centromere during DNA synthesis
* Staining patterns

22 pairs are exactly the same and are called **autosomal chromosomes**. The 23rd pair is different
between men and women. It's called the **sex chromosomes**. Men have a large X and small Y, women
have two large X's.

## Steps of Meiosis

Meiosis is a special type of cell division which separates homologous pairs of chromosomes so that
gametes receive one of each type of chromosome.

Meiosis is similar to mitosis in many ways:

* Cells undergoing meiosis will receive a signal causing them to leave G1 of interphase and enter S1
* At S phase, cells copy all chromosomes creating identical sister chromatids attached at the
  centromere
* Cells proceed through G2 and enter into meiosis
* Chromosomes are moved in a similar way to mitosis and have the four phases just like mitosis

The purpose of meiosis I is to separate pairs of homologous chromosomes. Meiosis II separates sister
chromatids.

Meiosis 1:

1. Prophase 1: nuclear membrane breaks down, nucleoli disappear, homologous chromosomes find each
   other and pair up. The chromosomes coil up and spindle attaches to chromosomes
2. Metaphase 1: chromosome pairs line up in middle of cell
3. Anaphase 1: chromosome pairs separate, one from each goes to opposite ends of cell
4. Telophase 1: nuclear membrane forms to make two nuclei, they're haploid
5. Cytokinesis: formation of two cells

After meiosis 1, both cells skip interphase and go straight to meiosis 2:

1. Prophase 2: spindle forms and attaches to chromosomes, breaks nuclear membrane
2. Metaphase 2: chromosomes are lined up in the middle of the cell
3. Anaphase 2: sister chromatids are separated and move to opposite sides of the cell
4. Telophase 2: chromosomes uncoil, spindle breaks down, nuclear membrane reforms, nucleoli reappear
5. Cytokinesis: formation of two cells each - total of four cells

## Crossing Over

During prophase 1 of meiosis 1, sometimes bits of DNA are swapped between two homologous chromosomes
via a process called **crossing-over**. It actually swaps pieces of chromosomes from Mom with Dad
and vice versa.

Crossing over helps increase the genetic diversity of gamete cells. The steps are:

1. Homologous chromosomes are attached all long their length
2. Proteins make small cuts into the DNA backbone of chromosomes
3. Proteins reseal the breaks in the DNA backbone, attaching pieces of one homologous chromosome to
   the other

# Mendelian Genetics: Talkin' 'Bout the Generations

## Overview

**Genetics** is the study of how parents pass traits on to their children. Gregor Mendel began work
on genetics and is credited to starting the field. He made a few laws known as Mendel's Laws:

* Law of Dominance: one form of a trait can hide another form. The hidden form is said to be
  **recessive** and the other is **dominant**
* Law of Segregation: gametes (sperm, eggs) only receive one of two messages for each trait from the
  adult
* Law of Independent Assortment: each pair of genetic messages sort itself independently from other
  pairs of genetic messages - roundness and color are segregated independently

## Lingo

Here are some keywords used in genetics:

* Gene: a message for a particular trait
* Allele: different variations of a gene

For example, pea plants have a gene for flower color. One allele is purple flowers while another is
white flowers.

* Genotype: total of all genetic messages in an organism
* Phenotype: the way an organism appears and functions because of its genes
* Homozygous: when an organism has two identical alleles for a gene
* Heterozygous: when an organism has two different alleles for a gene, sometimes called hybrid

When analyzing breeding, scientists have some common notations:

* P1 is the parental generation and always pure-breeds
* F1 is the first generation resulting from two P1s, stands for first filial generation
* F2 is the second generation resulting from two members of F1

## Punnett Squares

Punnett squares are grids used to figure out the probability of alleles. The edges are symbols
representing alleles, the squares are possible combos, capital letters for dominant, lower case for
recessive:

        r    r           R    r
      +----+----+      +----+----+
    R | Rr | Rr |    R | RR | Rr |
      +----+----+      +----+----+
    R | Rr | Rr |    r | Rr | rr |
      +----+----+      +----+----+

The left punnett square represents members of P1. RR is the round pea, rr is the recessive wrinkled
pea. No matter what, offspring will always end up Rr - round.

The right punnett square represents members of F1. Here you have a 3:1 ratio of round peas to
wrinkled peas.

## Meiosis

Scientists today have discovered the factors of inheritance that Mendel proposed are located on
chromosomes made of DNA. Parents have two copies of each gene, they segregate when given to the
offspring. The segregation occurs during anaphase 1 of meiosis.

# Expect the Unexpected: Non-Mendelian Patterns of Inheritance

## Overview

Traits don't always behave the way Mendel described. Scientists have discovered types of inheritance
that are complicated by other factors:

* Incomplete Dominance: phenotype is somewhere between the dominant and recessive
* Codominance: two different alleles contribute equally to phenotype
* Pleiotropy: one gene has an effect on many different phenotypes
* Polygenic Traits: many genes effect one phenotype
* Linked Genes: close together on chromosome and break law of indie assortment
* Sex-linked Traits: located on the sex chromosomes, X or Y

## Incomplete Dominance

The dominant allele only partially masks the presence of the recessive allele. A good example is the
color of snapdragons. The red (R) allele is incompletely dominant to the white (W) allele. RR is
red, WW is white, RW is pink.

## Codominance

Codominance is similar to incomplete dominance, except there's no blending. Both traits will show up
in the offspring. For the snapdragon example, both red and white colors will appear in the flower.

A real world example is blood type. There are three alleles: IA, IB, and i. They represent the
blueprint of enzymes that attach carbohydrates to your blood cells. IA attaches carbohydrate A. IB
attaches carbohydrate B. Allele i does not attach a carbohydrate.

IAIA or IAi offspring have A blood type. IBIB or IBi offspring have B blood type. IAIB have AB blood
type - both carbohydrates will be present. ii will have O blood type.

## Pleiotropy

Genes that affect more than one trait are called pleiotropy. A good example is the gene that causes
sickle cell anemia. The hemogoblin gene controls the structure and function of hemogoblin. When two
recessive, defective alleles are present they also:

* Cause anemia and extreme fatigue due to destruction of red blood cells
* Cause sickled cells that plug capillaries
* Cause the kidney and spleen to fail

## Polygenic Traits

When many genes effect one phenotype, the trait is polygenic. For example, eye color is polygenic.

Eye color is determined by the amount of melanin in your eye. There are many genes which control the
melanin deposit in your eye/face/skin. People with dark eyes have a lot of melanin, people with
light eyes have fewer melanin. The alleles which deposits a lof of melanin are dominant to the
alleles which deposit fewer.

Since there are many genes for the eye color trait, there's a wide range of eye colors. From dark
brown to light blue, there's green and even purple.

## Linked Genes

Some traits are linked together. A person who is heterozygous for two traits, controlled by genes A
and B, will make different gametes depending on if the genes are unlinked or linked:

* if independent, a heterozygote (AaBb) will make gametes of all possible combinations: AB, Ab, aB,
  and ab
* if linked, a heterozygote (AaBb) will only make AB or ab

Traits are linked because the genes are located on the same chromosome. The tendency of linking is
correlated with how close they are together.

Genes that are very close together are said to be completely linked - they always appear linked. The
only time they aren't is if cross-over occurs.

## Sex-Linked Inheritance

Some traits break Mendel's law because they aren't equally inherited by males and females. These are
known as sex-linked traits. This happens when the gene is on the X or Y chromosomes.

X-linked dominant traits affect both males and females. Y-linked traits affect only men.

The human X chromosome contains more than a thousand genes, while the human Y chromosome only has
about 200 genes.

# DNA Synthesis: Doubling Your Genetic Stuff

## Overview

Cells copy their DNA by a process called **DNA Replication**. Before a cell divides, it needs to
copy its DNA which contains the blueprints of functioning. Any mistake in the DNA code is called a
**mutation**, which could mess up the cell's functioning.

To make an exact copy of DNA, cells use **semiconservative replication**. The two halves separate
and each half serves as a template to synthesize another half. Each old strand gets a new partner.

## Enzymes

The enzymes involved in DNA replication:

* Helicase breaks or melts the hydrogen bonds that hold the two halves of the double helix together
* Topoisomerase breaks and reseals the backbone to release tension
* Primase (RNA polymerase) puts down small pieces of RNA called **primers**, serving as starting
  points for copying the DNA
* DNA polymerase makes new strands of DNA. DNA polymerase III builds new strand using complements of
  the template. DNA polymerase I replaces RNA nucleotides in the primer with DNA nucleotides
* DNA ligase seals up breaks in the DNA backbone by forming covalent bonds

The enzymes work together in a crew, called enzyme complex. They slide along the DNA, copying as
they go.

## Replication

DNA replication starts at specific locations of chromosomes called **origins of replication**.
Proteins recognize the origin, opens the helix there, and the enzyme complexes begins copying the
DNA. Two enzyme complexes move in opposite directions, copying DNA in both directions.

As replication occurs, a **replication bubble** is formed. On both sides are V-shaped areas where
DNA is being opened upcalled **replication forks**. This happens because the enzyme complexes are
moving in opposite directions. The forks are where copying is currently occurring.

After DNA has been opened at the origin, the enzyme helicase catalyze the breaking of hydrogen
bonds. Helicase is like the metal piece that slides along zippers. Once separated, proteins called
single-strand DNA-binding proteins will hold the DNA open so the strands don't re-bond.

As the strands get separated, the double helix backbone gets tension. Topoisomerase catalyzes the
breaking of covalent bonds in the backbone. This untwists DNA and relieves the backbone of tension.

Primase creates short pieces of RNA (primers) that are complementary to the DNA. Once the primers
are made, DNA polymerase III starts attaching DNA nucleotides to the 3' ends of the primers. It uses
the original strand of DNA as a template and continues synthesizing DNA down the line.

DNA polymerase I slides along the new DNA strand and replaces the RNA nucleotides with their DNA
counterpart.

Some covalent bonds are missing in the backbone now. There are gaps between the primers and the DNA
synthesized by DNA polymerase III. The ligase enzyme goes along the strand and seals those gaps in
the backbone.

## Leading and Lagging Strands

The two strands of the double helix are antiparallel to each other. The 5' and 3' ends are always
pointing in opposite directions.

DNA polymerase III always adds nucleotides to the 3' ends. This presents a problem to the enzyme
complex, which moves as one unit.

To solve it, DNA polymerase creates short pieces of DNA and then skips to the next primer. These
pieces are called **Okasaki fragments**.

The new strand made in fragments is called the **lagging strand**. This strand must be started over
and over again. RNA polymerase keeps putting down primers so the DNA polymerase III can keep
working.

The opposite strand doesn't have this problem and is called the **leading strand**. Remember, the
leading/lagging strand always refer to the new strands of DNA. Also remember, DNA always have
nucleotides added to the 3' ends.

Cells with linear chromosomes (including humans) the lagging strand gets shorter every time the DNA
is copied. This happens at the very end of chromosomes. Once the primer is removed, there's no room
for a new primer and DNA can't copy without a primer. The ends of chromosomes are capped with
repetitive DNA sequences called **telomeres**. They act like buffers which can be shortened because
they don't contain useful information for the cell. Once it becomes too short, though, the cell can
no longer divide without losing critical information.

# Transcription and Translation: What's in a Gene?

## Overview

DNA contains the genetic code of the cell which controls the cell's structure and function. This
chapter explains how the cell uses those instructions to make worker molecules - which actually does
the cell's function.

The worker molecules are:

* RNA molecules - information carriers and enzymes (called ribozymes)
* Proteins - main worker molecules performing wide range of functions

A **gene** is the blueprint for a single worker molecule. If your genome is a file cabinet,
chromosomes are drawers, and genes are files. Humans have 46 chromosomes and ~22,500 genes.

A high level view of how we go from DNA to proteins:

1. Gene in DNA is copied into a messenger molecule called **messenger RNA or mRNA** via a process
   called **transcription**.
2. mRNA goes to ribosomes where it goes through **translation** to build a protein. The protein is
   made from amino acids attached to **translation RNA or tRNA**.

The flow of information to build a protein (DNA -> RNA -> protein) is called the **central dogma of
molecular biology**.

## Transcription

During transcription, the double helix of DNA is opened and one strand of DNA is used as a template
for construction of an RNA molecule. Transcription can make several types of RNA, not just mRNA.

Genes only make up 2% of DNA, we're still trying to figure out what the other 98% do.

Cells recognize genes for proteins by their **promoters** - unique sequences of DNA located at
beginning of genes. Going back to the file cabinet analogy, promoters are like those tabs on files
that let you quickly find a file.

**RNA polymerase** is the enzyme that reads genes and copies the information into RNA. It also
catalyzes the covalent bonds between nucleotides. The DNA strand being read is called the **template
strand**. The other is called **nontemplate strand (also called coding strand)**.

RNA polymerase need helpers to recognize promoters. In bacteria, **sigma proteins** attach to the
polymerase and form a holoenzyme. The holoenzyme attaches to promoters and the polymerase can begin
transcription. In eukaryotes, the regulary proteins are **transcription factors**.

**Transcription terminators** are the opposite of promoters, they mark the end of genes. It contains
code that makes the RNA to fold back on itself, forming a hairpin loop and knocking the RNA
polymerase off the DNA.

The transcribed RNA is still not ready to be translated. Right now it's called **pre-mRNA or primary
RNA transcript**. The RNA code contains **introns** - short stretches of nucleotides that don't code
for the protein. These introns need to be removed. The portions which contain code for proteins are
called **exons**, which remain in the final mRNA.

    Exons are expressed; introns are interrupt

Particles called snRPs ("snurps") made from RNA/proteins remove the introns. This method is called
splicing. After splicing, the cell has two more steps:

1. A protective cap - 5' cap - is added to the 5' end. It identifies finished mRNA for the cell
2. Enzymes clip off the 3' end of the pre-mRNA and replace it with between 100 and 250 adenine
   nucleotides called the **poly-A tail** which protects the finished mRNA

## Translation

The mRNA is shipped out to the ribosomes in the cell's cytoplasm. The tRNAs use the mRNA to build
the protein. The cell reads mRNA in blocks of three nucleotides called **codons**. Each codon tells
the cell which amino acid to attach to the polypeptide chain.

Twenty different amino acids exist and there are 64 possible combinations for codons (4^3). The
genetic code is redundant, some amino acids are represented by more than one codon.

Scientists have made a codon dictionary. Given a strand of RNA, you can figure out which amino acids
they represent and in what order. Follow these steps:

1. Find large row on left of table with first letter of codon
2. Find column that's the second letter of codon, use the entire area
3. For the area, find small row on right of table with third letter of codon
4. The intersection of all three is the amino acid

Each mRNA molecule has a section near the 5' cap that's recognizable by the ribosome called the
**ribosomal binding site** and isn't part of the code for protein. The protein code starts at the
START codon or AUG. It's decoded in the 5' to 3' direction until it hits a STOP codon (UAA, UGA, or
UAG). Then just read each nucleotide by groups of three.

**tRNA or Transfer RNA** is the decoder. tRNA molecules carry in the amino acids for the protein and
figure out where to place them in the polypeptide chain.

tRNA molecules have an **anticodon** structure made up of three nucleotides. These three nucleotides
will pair with the codon of mRNA, binding with hydrogen bonds just like the two strands of DNA. For
example, the tRNA's anticodon may be 3'UAC5' and will fit correctly with mRNA's 5'AUG3'. 40 tRNAs
exist.

The matching arranges the amino acids in the correct order - which mRNA decides. Ribosomes organize
the meeting of mRNA and tRNA. Ribosomes have pockets called the A site, P site, and E site. tRNAs
enter through the A site, move through the P site, and exit at the E site. The ribosome also
catalyzes peptide bonds as they're being brought together.

Translation occurs in three phases:

1. Initiation of translation: subunit of ribosome binds to mRNA, tRNA binds its anticodon to the
   START codon, large subunit of ribosome binds to small subunit and mRNA. Second codon of mRNA is
   at A site.
2. Elongation of translation: amino acids are brought together and joined to form a polypeptide
   chain
3. Termination of translation: stop codon enters A site and is recognized by an enzyme called
   **release factor**, which catalyzes the break up

## Mutation

Changes in DNA are called **mutations** and may result in disease or death. DNA polymerase doesn't
often make mistakes copying DNA and it proofreads its own work. It still makes one uncorrected
mistake for approximately every billion base pairs of DNA. Mutations that just happen because of the
enzyme are called **spontaneous mutations**.

Cells have a lot of DNA. Every time a cell divides, there will be approximately six mutations.

Certain chemicals and types of radiation in the environment will increase the mutation rate of DNA
polymerase. Agents that increase the rate are **mutagens** and mutations that result from it are
**induced mutations**.

Cells can function fine with mutations due to a few reasons. Not all mutations cause changes in
proteins - they may change DNA outside of genes. Even if it does occur in the gene, it may not
affect the final protein (AAA and AAG code for the same amino acid). These are **silent mutations**.

Other types of mutations are:

* Missense mutations change of amino acids in proteins
* Nonsense mutations prematurely encode a stop codon for proteins
* Frameshift mutations causes reading frame of mRNA to be altered

# Control of Gene Expression: It's How You Play Your Cards That Counts

## Overview

**Gene regulation** is about cells choosing which genes to use and which to not use. Genes are
**expressed** when cells are using the gene to make a **gene product** (usually protein or RNA).

Gene regulation is important for specialized cells. Your original cell was a **stem cell** with the
potential to become any type of cell. Descendants are given signals to become specialists. Signals
turn on/off genes.

Cells that become specialists are **differentiated** for a certain task. Cell differentiation is
achieved through **differential gene expression**. Differentiated cells have access only to the
genes they need to survive and perform their function.

Some genes are essential for all cells' survival and are always turned on. This includes genes for
metabolism and DNA/RNA synthesis.

Cells have two types of genes based on gene expression:

* Constitutive gene: expressed all the time
* Regulated gene: turned on and off as needed by cells

## Gene Expression in Bacteria

Bacteria has to regulate its gene to take advantage of the current situation. For examples,
sometimes there's ample food or a scarcity. The basic steps for regulating genes in bacteria are:

1. Cell receives an environmental signal
2. Signal activates or de-activates a DNA-binding protein
3. DNA-binding proteins either bind or let go of regulatory DNA sequences
4. Transcription is turned on or off by DNA binding proteins

Multiple genes are under the control of a promoter - all together they're called an **operon** for
bacteria. The genes in an operon are usually for a single process so all proteins for a process are
made during transcription/translation of the operon. Some properties of the operon:

* promoter marks the beginning of the operon
* structural genes are genes for proteins within the operon
* the operator is a regulatory sequence of DNA between the promoter and the structural genes

**Escherichia coli or E. coli** has a bad rap, but most strands of it are nice. It's bacteria that's
great for studying and the nice ones even exist in your stomach. E coli is often used for studying
gene expression.

Food sources are unpredictable for bacteria, so E coli will turn on or off the enzymes to break food
particles in certain situations. We'll take a look at how E coli breaks down lactose - a sugar found
in milk.

The genes for producing enzymes that breakdown lactose are called the lactose operon or lac operon.
The lac operon has three components: promoter, operator which is the binding site for DNA-binding
protein called lac repressor protein, and three structural genes (two proteins and one protective
enzyme). The structural genes are for:

* lacZ gene blueprint for beta-galactosidase enzyme that catalyzes the splitting of disaccharide
  lactose into two monosaccharides, glucose and galactose, and then glycolysis breaks it down
* lacY gene for membrane protein galactosidase permease which brings lactose into the cell
* lacA gene blueprint for transacetylase, protective enzyme that allows certain sugars to be removed
  from the cell when sugars are too plentiful

The **lac repressor** is a DNA-binding protein that regulates the lac operon (it controls the
transcription). It has two binding sites critical to its function: a **DNA-binding site** that binds
to the operator of the lac operon, a **allosteric site** that binds to an isomer of lactose. When
lactose is present at the allosteric site, the repressor is de-activated. When it's missing, the
repressor is activated. The operator of the lac operon is next to the promoter, so when lac
repressor is active - it'll get in the way of RNA polymerase.

So the lac repressor guarantees effeciency. When lactose is present, the cell will use transcribe
the lac operon gene. When lactose isn't present, transcription is blocked and the cell won't waste
its resources. It all comes down to whether lactose is bound to the allosteric site of the lac
repressor.

## Gene Expression in Eukaryotes

Gene expression in eukaryotes is a bit more complicated but has some similarities to gene expression
in bacteria:

* regulation at the level of transcription called **transcription control** is the same for both
* DNA-binding proteins regulate the activity of genes by binding to regulatory sequences in the DNA
  for both

The pathway from genes to proteins is more complicated in eukaryotes, so there are more
opportunities for regulation:

* access to genes is affected by compaction of DNA into chromosomes
* transcriptional controls regulate whether RNA polymerase binds to promoters
* control of RNA processing determines if pre-mRNA is processed to mRNA
* control of mRNA stability determines how long it is available for translation
* translational control regulates if mRNA is translated into protein
* control of protein modification determines if polypeptide can become fully functional protein

If you unpack the DNA from a single cell into a straight line, it'd be about 6 feet in length.
Eukaryotic cells pack DNA into **chromatin**, a complex of DNA wound around protein. The steps to
packaging DNA are:

1. DNA molecules are wounded around positively charged proteins called histones that gather together
   in groups of eight proteins. Beads of DNA plus histones are called nucleosomes.
2. String of nucleosomes and DNA twist until they form coiled fibers that are 30 nanometers wide
3. Continued twisting of the DNA and protein fibers packs the DNA even more tightly until DNA is
   very condensed

Because the DNA is so tightly coiled up, regulatory proteins and RNA polymerase can't get access to
the genes. Before transcription can occur, the chromatin of the gene must be decondensed. Histone
acetyl transferases (HATs) proteins control the condensation of chromatin (they attach acteyl groups
to histone proteins which neutralize their positive charge). When the DNA becomes less attracted it
will loosen and decondense.

**Regulatory proteins** bind to **regulatory sequences** of DNA located near promoters. Regulatory
proteins controls transcription in eukaryotes. They work similar to bacteria's transcription control
but are wider in variety:

* Promoter proximal elements: sequences located close to promoters. When regulatory proteins bind to
  these, transcription is turned on. Each exact sequence is unique so cells know which genes they're
  switching on/off.
* Enhancers: regulatory sequences located far away from genes they regulate. When regulatory
  proteins bind to them, transcription is on.
* Silencers: regulatory sequences located far away, but when regulatory proteins bind to these
  transcription is off.

Regulatory proteins that bind to regulatory sequences in order to turn on transcription are called
transcription factors. There are two types:

* General transcription factors: aka basal transcription factors are required for transcription of
  any gene in all cell types and work to attract RNA polymerase to bind them to promoters
* Regulatory transcription factors: more targeted, bind to regulatory sequences of specific genes

Proteins called **coactivators** bind to transcription factors and bring them together to form
transcription initiation complex. They initiate transcription.

# Recombinant DNA Technology: Power Tools at the Cellular Level

## Overview

Scientists are able to read, copy, cut, sort, and replace DNA. When DNA comes from two different
sources it's called **recombinant DNA**. Scientists have combined human genes and DNA from E. coli
and placed them into E. coli, so it produces human insulin. Doctors use the insulin to treat human.

## Cutting DNA with restriction enzymes

**Restriction endonucleases or restriction enzymes** are made by bacteria and cut strands of DNA
into smaller pieces. It's used to fight off viruses, chopping off infected DNA so it can't destroy
the entire cell. Restriction enzymes make cutting/combining pieces of DNA easy.

A **plasmid** is a DNA molecule separate from chromosomal DNA that can replicate on its own. It's
usually in a ring shape and found in bacteria (though sometimes can be found in eukaryotes).

Example of cutting a human gene and placing it into bacteria:

1. Choose a restriction enzyme that forms sticky ends when it cuts DNA, sticky ends being pieces of
   single stranded DNA that are complementary
2. Cut the human DNA and bacterial plasmids with restriction enzymes
3. Combine human DNA and bacterial plasmids
4. Use DNA ligase to seal the backbone of the DNA

## Sorting molecules using gel electrophoresis

**Gel electrophoresis** separates molecules based on their size and electrical charge. The gel is
made of a gelatin-like polysacharrides. Molecules are placed into pockets of the gel (usually DNA or
proteins) and will be moved by a charge.

       Anode +
     +---------+
     | o  O  o |  <-- large, low positive charge
     | -  O  O |  <-- small, low positive charge
     | -  -  o |  <-- large, high positive charge
     | -  -  - |  <-- small, high positive charge
     +---------+
      Cathode -

* Molecules are attracted to electrode with opposite charge
* Small molecules can move more quickly through gel than large molecules, causing molecules to be
  separated by size. The long fibers of polysacharrides throughout the gel act as obstacles for the
  molecules - which smaller molecules can move through quicker.

Gel electrophoresis is often used to separate DNA from other molecules. DNA has a negative charge
due to its phosphate groups. "DNA runs to red" because the positive side is red. The steps to do it:

1. Pour liquid gel and let it solidify. There's a comb on the gel platform which creates little
   pockets called wells in the gel.
2. Place gel into an electrophoresis chamber and fill chamber with buffer. The buffer is a solution
   that conducts electricity.
3. Cut DNA samples with restriction enzymes and mix samples with loading buffer. The buffer settles
   the DNA into the wells and marks them with dye.
4. Load samples into wells using a micropipettor. DNA will sink to bottom.
5. Seal the box and start the current to separate DNA samples.
6. Stop the current and stain the gel. Stain will stick to DNA and create stripes called bands. Each
   band represents a collection of DNA molecules of the same size.

## Making cDNA with reverse transcriptase

Earlier, Kratz mentioned how we add human DNA into bacteria to create human proteins. Human DNA has
introns and bacteria doesn't know how to splice pre mRNA. To get around this issue, scientists
create intron-free genes in the form of **complementary DNA or cDNA**.

cDNA is made from eukaryotic mRNA that has already been spliced. The steps to make cDNA are:

1. Isolate mRNA from protein you're interested in
2. Use enzyme reverse transcriptase to make a single-stranded DNA moelcule that is complementary to
   the mRNA (it's a viral enzyme that uses RNA as a template to make DNA)
3. Use reverse transcriptase or DNA polymerase to make a partner strand

## Cloning genes into a library

DNA cloning makes many identical copies of the gene. To clone a gene, you put the gene in a
**vector** (plasmid or virus DNA) that helps carry DNA into a cell. The steps are:

1. Use restriction enzyme to cut the vector and target DNA containing the gene to have same sticky
   ends.
2. Mix the vector and DNA together and add DNA ligase. Vectors picking up genes are said to be
   recombinant.
3. Introduce the vector into a population of cells. The vector will be reproduced inside the cells
   and the gene will be cloned

DNA libraries are recombinant vectors that store genes and keep them handy for scientists to use.

## Finding a gene with DNA probes

Scientists use DNA probes to find vectors containing specific genes in DNA libraries. Probes are
single stranded DNA complementary to the sequence you're looking for. It's like fishing - catching
means forming hydrogen bonds.

1. Prepare DNA sample to be probed for the gene of interest. Treat it with heat or chemicals to make
   it single-stranded.
2. Wash DNA probe over the surface of DNA sample
3. Locate probe to find gene of interest

## Copying a gene with PCR

The **polymerase chain reaction (PCR)** lets you make copies of genes. It can turn a single copy of
genes into billions in a few hours. Doing this is also known as gene amplification. The DNA sample
that contains the gene to be amplified is combined with thousands of copies of the primers so DNA
polymerase creates thousands of strands. The steps are:

1. Heat sample for 1 minute to disrupt hydrogen bonds to make DNA single-stranded
2. Cool sample for 1 minute so hydrogen bonds can reform. Primers will stick with hydrogen bonds to
   single-stranded target DNA
3. Heat sample to optimum temperature for DNA polymerase

Repeat these three steps 30 times.

## Reading a gene with DNA sequencing

DNA sequencing determines the order of nucleotides in a DNA strand. It uses a special nucleotide
called dideoxy-ribonucleotide triphosphate (ddNTP) which are like typical nucleotides except instead
of the hydroxyl group attached to 3' carbon it's just hydrogen. If ddNTP gets attached to the
growing chain of nucleotides while DNA polymerase is copying DNA, it'll be the last one added to the
chain. The chain interruption determines the order of nucleotides.

**Cycle sequencing** combines original methods of DNA sequencing with PCR.

## Fixing a broken gene with gene therapy

Introducing a gene in order to cure a genetic disease is called **gene therapy** and it's still far
from perfect:

* scientists must discover safe vectors that can transfer genes into human cells
* scientists must develop methods for introducing therapeutic genes into population of targeted
  cells (ie only affected cells)
* stem cells producing target population of cells must be identified

# Genomics: The Big Picture

## Overview

**Genomics** is the study of the entire DNA sequence of an organism. The Human Genome Project
sequenced the entire genome of a human and developed faster methods for DNA sequencing.

Genomics research is taking several approaches now:

* Comparative genomics compares genomes from different species to better understand evolution and
  determine function of genes and noncoding regions
* Functional genomics tries to figure out functions of genes
* Pharmacogenomics studies how a person's unique genome affects their response to drugs with a goal
  of highly effective/individualized drug development

## Shotgun Sequencing

**Shotgun sequencing** is a fast sequencing method which breaks apart the genome into small
fragments, sequence the fragments, then re-assemble it. Here is how to do hierarchical shotgun
sequencing:

1. Cut genomic DNA into fragments of 150 million base pairs
2. Place fragments into vector then clone into bacteria to be replicated
3. Large fragments are mapped and organized
4. Each large fragments are broken up to set of smaller fragments
5. Small fragments are sequenced
6. Computer lines up overlapping sequences to determine order of small fragments

Right now pathogens are being sequenced to help develop new strategies to fight diseases.
Extremophiles are being studied for industrial use (organisms that can live in extreme conditions).
Crop plants and model organisms are also being studied for agriculture and comparison to humans.

## Looking within the human genome

Some interesting facts about the human genome:

* We only have about 25,000 genes (before HGP, we expected 100,000)
* Average gene size is about 3,000 base pairs long
* Number of genes vary from 2,968 genes on chromosome 1 to 231 genes on Y
* At least 50% of DNA is noncoding
* Genes are randomly clustered together on chromosomes and separated from other clusters of genes by
  noncoding DNA
* Areas of DNA with genes contain lots of G-C base pairs. Noncoding regions contain lots of A-T base
  pairs
* Less than 2% of genome code for proteins and RNA molecules. The other 98% has other functions or
  we don't know yet. The other functions include: regulatory sequences used for promoters or origins
  of replication, structuring DNA within the cell, junk DNA (50%, we don't know what it's for),
  pseudogenes are mutated relics of formerly functioning genes

## Comparative Genomics

Scientists use computers to look for regions of DNA that are similar across different organisms. It
will help answer questions about evolution, gene function across organisms, genes for unique
features, and effects of natural selection.

All life on Earth is very similar. Human genome is 99.9% identical to other humans, 96% identical to
chimpanzees, and 40% identical to mice.

More genes or bigger genome doesn't mean a more complicated organism. The size of a genome doesn't
correlate with how many genes it has. Mice have 2.5 million base pairs in the genome and 30,000
genes. Humans have 3 million base pairs but less genes (25,000).

Some organisms have evolved to have multiple sets of chromosomes. They're **polyploid** organisms
and usually have larger genomes. Some organisms, like humans, have a lot of repetition in their DNA.
Humans have an "Alu" sequence which is 300 base pairs long and appears more than 1.1 million times.

## Functional Genomics

Scientists are trying to answer these questions with functional genomics:

* How much variation is there within a genome?
* When and where does gene expression occur?
* How do genes and the products of different genes interact with each other?

Genes are encoded with open reading frames (sections of DNA that begin with START codon and end with
STOP codon). Scientists are searching through these to discover new proteins.

Gene expression is an important part of functional genomics, especially in cancer research. To
determine which genes are expressed at any one time, geneticists track the presence of RNA sequences
in cells using DNA microarrays.

A DNA microarray is a glass slide with many single-stranded copies of DNA for a single gene stuck to
it. To use it:

1. Molecules of mRNA are isolated from the two cells to be compared
2. Reverse transcription produces labeled cDNA copies of each population of mRNA
3. The cDNA molecules from each cell are washed over DNA microarray surface. They'll stick to any
   complementary molecules on the glass slide
4. Use a laser to activate fluorescent tags on the cDNA molecules and observe color patterns to
   determine which DNA sequences are being expressed

## Pharmacogenomics

Pharmacogenomics combines pharmacology and genomics to tailor drug therapies to a specific
individual. With it, scientists hope to better associate genes and proteins with a disease. They can
figure out the best treatment for a person with a particular genotype. They can do pre-emptive check
ups using the genome to figure out which disease a person is most likely to get.

## Systems Biology

A lot of genome information is available on the internet! Scientists all over the world are mining
this information to learn and contribute.
