## Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products

by Nir Eyal and Ryan Hoover

#### Introduction

* Today, amassing millions of users is not good enough. Companies find that their economic value is a function of the strength of the habits that they create. They must understand what makes makes users click, and what makes them tick.
* Habit-forming companies link their services to users' daily routines and emotions. They are a "first-to-mind" solution. You must manufacture these habits.
* Habit-forming products start by alerting users with external *triggers* like email, a website link, or the app icon on a phone. 
* The next step is the *action*, or behavior done in anticipation of the reward. Companies increase the likelihood of action by making it easy and tapping into our psychological motivation to do it.
* The next step is the *reward*. Making the reward variable supresses the areas of the brain associated with judgment and reason, and activates the parts associated with wanting and desire.
* The final step is *investment*, where the user puts something into the product such as time, data, effort, social capital, or money. It implies an action that improves the service for the next go-around.

#### Ch 1: The Habit Zone

* Habits give us the ability to focus our attention on other things by storing automatic responses.
* Fostering customer habits is an effective way to increase the value of a company by driving higher customer lifetime value, and a business is worth the sum of its future profits.
* As customers form routines around a product, they depend on it and become less price-sensitive. See free-to-play video games, where developers delay asking for money until the user plays consistently and habitually.
* Hooked users become brand evangelists. When this happens, the most important factor to increasing growth is the "Viral Cycle Time," which is the amount of time it takes a user to invite another user.
* John Gourville, a professor of marketing at HBS, says that "many innovations fail because consumsers irrationally overvalue the old while companies irrationally overvalue the new." 
* Products that require a high degree of behavior change are doomed to fail even if the benefits of using the new product are clear and substantial. Because old habits die hard.
* Non-transferrable value created and stored inside a service discourages a user from leaving.
* New behaviors have a short shelf-life. The habits that we've most recently acquired are also the ones that are likely to go soonest.
* Frequent engagement with a product, especially over a short period of time, increases the likelihood of forming new routines.
* For an infrequent action to become a habit, the user must preceive a high degree of utility, either from gaining pleasure or avoiding pain.
* A behavior that occurs with high frequency but less utility, or an app that occurs with low frequency but more utility, has habit-forming potential.
* Habit-forming services seem, at first, to be offering nice-to-have vitamins, but once the habit is established, they provide an ongoing pain remedy.
* Addictions are self-destructive. A habit is a behavior that can have a positive influence on a person's life, but can be healthy or unhealthy.
