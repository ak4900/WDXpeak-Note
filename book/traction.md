# Traction

How to gain traction using 19 channels by Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares.

# Overview and Bullseye Framework

The Bullseye Framework can be used to find the best marketing channel. Since marketing channels
saturate over time, you'll want to rinse and repeat.

1. Brainstorm - come up with reasonable ways to use each traction channel
2. Rank - rank each channel by 3 categories: most promising, potential, long-shot
3. Prioritize - if you only have 3 in most promising, you're done, otherwise eliminate until you
   have 3
4. Test - try them out and measure results to determine best channel
5. Focus - focus on that single channel

**Spend your time 50% on product and 50% on traction.**

Look for ways to quantify your marketing efforts. Always run A/B tests to optimize. Develop cheap
tests to validate assumptions.

Always have a traction goal to work towards, eg have 1000 paying customers to 100 new daily users.

# Viral Marketing

Build loops into your product: word of mouth, inherent, collaborative, communicative, incentives,
embedded, and social.

Viral coefficient is the number of additional users that come from each single user you bring in.
Over 1 indicates exponential growth. Viral cycle time is how long it takes for a user to go through
a viral loop. Aim to shorten this time.

Always be testing and measuring your viral strategy.

# Public Relations

PR focuses on coverage from traditional news outlets, newspapers, etc...

Stories filter up. Major news outlets look to major blogs, which look at smaller blogs and forums.
Target multiple smaller sites and your story will end up in bigger news outlets.

Build relationships with specific reporters (read their articles, comment, offer industry
experience, etc...) See HARO.

Package milestones into an emotional story and reach out to reporters.

# Unconventional PR

Divided into two: publicity stunts and small tokens of customer appreciation. Publicity stunts need
to be new, creative, and extraordinary to be covered in the press. Customer appreciation is more
sustainable over the long term.

An example: Hipmunk hired an artist to draw chipmunk profiles for their customers. Hundreds of
customers requested for a drawing. They also ran a contest for customers to submit why they love
their mothers more than Hipmunk on Mother's Day. The winners got free flowers and chocolate for
their mothers. This made customers happy and got press coverage.

Success through this channel is unpredictable.

# Search Engine Marketing

SEM is placing ads on search engine pages. Short glossary:

* CTR is click through rate - percentage of people who click after seeing the ad
* CPC is cost per click - amount it costs to buy a click
* CPA is cost per acquisition - amount it costs to acquire a customer

Search engine ads is ideal for testing product positioning/messaging before developing it.

Your first SEM ads usually won't even break even. Always test the ad messaging and record the number
of conversions. You can test:

* keywords
* ad copy
* demographic targeting
* landing pages
* CPC bids

Long tail keywords are less competitive and can be more profitable. Pay close attention to ad
quality scores.

# Social & Display Ads

These advertisements appear on social and other websites. You have several options:

* Ad Networks, such as Google's
* Niche Ad Networks, such as The Deck or BuySell Ads
* Direct Ads, contact a single website directly
* Social Ads, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, StumbleUpon, Tumblr, Reddit, YouTube

Social ads should be used to build an audience and engage with them over time. Don't try to convert
people immediately. Instead, create free content to build a presence.

Copy your competitors' ads for ideas.

# Offline Ads

Offline ads include TV, infomercials, radio, magazines, newspapers, yellow pages, billboards, direct
mail. Look for niche audiences that resonate well with your product.

Always test with cheap packages first before scaling up.

# Search Engine Optimization

Two strategies: fat-head and long-tail. Fat-head means trying to rank for competitive and high value
search terms. Long-tail means less competition but less reward.

Long-tail SEO pairs well with having multiple landing pages. For example, Patrick McKenzie sells
Bingo Card Creator and created many small landing pages for terms such as "Owls of the East Bingo
Cards".

Could you automate your long-tail content creation? That's how user-generated sites get good search
rankings, such as Yelp or Wikipedia. Patrick McKenzie outsourced to freelancers to create multiple
landing pages.

Link building comes down to content and links. To get links: use PR, use content in product (like
Yelp), use content marketing, or use widgets.

# Content Marketing

Content marketing can be a huge investment, it will take 6 months or longer before taking off.

After writing posts, do things that don't scale initially such as reaching out to individuals to
share posts. This helps start the momentum of sharing.

Focus on quality content and write about problems your target customers have. Can you use your own
data to provide content that nobody else can (eg OkCupid's posts).

Other ways to share:

* reaching out to industry leaders
* guest posts
* writing about recent news/events
* infographics

# Email Marketing

Personalized email marketing works best. Don't theme your newsletter layout, keep it simple like a
message from family/friends.

Consider using transactional emails which are triggered specifically for each customer step:
acquisition, activation, retention, and conversion. You can also setup drip or lifecycle email
sequences which are automated.

The authors recommend building an email list regardless of your traction channel focus.

# Engineering as Marketing

Engineers can create low-friction ways for potential customers to engage with your product that
naturally leads to conversions. For example, a free web based tool for potential customers. HubSpot
did this with their Marketing Grader tool, which creates a free report on how well a website is
performing.

Keep tools as simple as possible. Make sure they're single-purpose that solve an obvious pain. Put
them on your website for a search engine boost.

Utilizing engineering resources for marketing to create assets is a great long term investment.

# Targeting Blogs

Find blogs that cater to your target audience via Google, YouTube, Twitter, etc... Contact these
blogs and get them to write about your product via: guest posts, giveaways, milestone announcements,
or anything that would be valuable to their audience. You could also do a sponsorship.

Targeting blogs is effective for your first wave of customers. Besides blogs, you can also target
link sharing communities such as Reddit or Hacker News.

# Business Development

Business development is the pursuit of a partnership that benefits both sides, such as two SaaS apps
integrating a feature with each other (eg time tracking with Harvest inside Basecamp). Another
example would be cross promotion, so both audiences can learn about each others' products.

When pursuing partnerships, always consider the other person's incentives. How can you make their
life easier or better?

Realize that most deals will fail.

# Sales

Works best for high priced products that require customer hand holding.

Try to create a sales system/model that's repeatable. Create a sales funnel for prospects to enter
at the top, qualify as leads, and close.

# Affiliate Programs

An arrangement where you pay people a commission when they refer a customer to you. You can use an
affiliate network like Commission Junction or create your own. The commission doesn't have to be
cash, it can be a bonus such as Dropbox's referral program.

How much are you willing to pay to acquire a customer? Keep track of how much is paid, how many
customers are converted, and make sure that you end up with a profit.

# Existing Platforms

Websites, apps, marketplaces, or networks with existing customers that you can introduce your
product to. For example: app stores or social platforms.

YouTube piggybacked off of MySpace, which didn't have a video hosting solution. Evernote saw a huge
spike after creating a browser extension. AirBnB created a "Post to Craigslist" feature to leverage
Craigslist audiences.

First, figure out where your customers hang out online. Then think of a feature that could leverage
that existing platform.

# Trade Shows

Visit a trade show the year before to see if it would be effective for your company.

Schedule meetings with potential customers or press long before the trade show. Utilize dinner
meetings.

Make sure your booth has strong calls to actions.

# Offline Events

Launching at conferences has been a successful tactic.

You can consider starting your own conference that brings together your target audience. You can
also throw a party alongside existing conferences for a more focused audience building tactic.

# Speaking Engagements

If you fit with the theme of an event, you're doing the event organizer a favor by speaking at it.

Organizers consider timing, topic, and credibility so you'll need to establish yourself as an expert
in that topic before submitting proposals.

Successful talks combine storytelling with advice. That way, your audience won't lose their
interest.

# Community Building

Building a community will cultivate and empower evangelists who will promote your product. You want
to connect them via forums and events.

Focus on quality early on and be sure to set standards. Systems that help with scaling quality
include karma, rules, etc...
