# The New Coffeehouse Investor

Bill Schulteis wrote The New Coffeehouse Investor as a guide/framework for everyday workers who
don't want to worry too much about their investments. We do want to know our money is safe and
growing for retirement, but we don't want to constantly check in and move it around.

The three major guidelines of this book are:

1. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your assets to maximize chances of reaching
   financial goal while reducing risk.
2. There is no such thing as a free lunch. Trying to beat the market is likely disastrous. It's
   better to capture the entire return of each asset class.
3. Save for a rainy day. Make a long-term financial plan and keep an eye on your savings and
   spending.

I like the advice in this book, but I think there's way too much anecdotes. For every one page of
financial advice, there's five about mountain climbing or cooking recipes.

The "Coffeehouse Portfolio" from the website (with index funds) is:

* 40% VBMFX: Fixed Income
* 10% VFINX: US Large Cap
* 10% VIVAX: US Large Cap/Value
* 10% NAESX: US Small Cap
* 10% VISVX: US Small Cap/Value
* 10% VGTSX: International
* 10% VGSIX: REITS

There's also a simpler, 3-fund portfolio:

* 33% VBMFX: Fixed Income
* 34% VTSMX: US Stock
* 33% VGTSX: International Stock

# The Coffeehouse Investor

This book does not show you how to pick hot funds or cool stocks. It just explains the three
guidelines mentioned above.

Schulteis argues that your life is more important and worthy of your focus than your investment
portfolio. You should still make financial goals and do a little planning, but you don't need to
spend every day updating your stock picks.

He mentions the three guidelines again:

1. Asset allocation
2. Approximate the stock market average
3. Saving

If you do these three things, you'll be able to reach your financial goals.

# This Thing Called Risk

Eliminate the risk you can control and reduce the risk you can't. Asset allocation just means
dividing your assets up in the right proportions among stocks, bonds, and cash.

Determine your time horizon - the years you have left to invest before you start drawing on your
investments. Use this to determine your allocation. The longer you have, the more risk you can
afford. More risk means more stock (bonds means less risk). Schulteis gives the following
allocations:

20-45 Conservative/Aggressive

* Cash 10/0%
* Bonds 20/0%
* Stocks 70/100%

40-60 Conservative/Aggressive

* Cash 10/5%
* Bonds 40/15%
* Stocks 50/80%

60+ Conservative/Aggressive

* Cash 10/10%
* Bonds 70/30%
* Stocks 20/60%

There are two types of investment risk: inflation and stock market volatility. Inflation is when
living expenses increase faster than income generated from investments. Stock market volatility is
the risk of losing money in the stock market.

The stock market may have its down periods - sometimes losing as much as 20% during three year
periods. But if you're in it for the long haul, it's worth investing in.

Inflation eats away your purchasing power slowly every year. College tuition, cars, houses - all of
these go up in price over the long-term. That's why it's important to invest your money instead of
letting it sit in cash.

# Approximating the Stock Market Average

The collective return of all publicly traded companies is measured via indexes like the S&P 500.
Wall Street tries to beat this index and charge you a fee for their services. Schulteis argues that
they can't.

* Only 27% of all managed funds beat the stock market average during the last 15 year period
* Only 55% beat the stock market during the last 10 year period
* Only 36% beat the stock market during the last 3 year period

These statistics would be worse if fees were included.

The alternative is to invest in stock index mutual funds. Investing in common stock lets you become
a part owner of that company. Investing in a mutual fund lets you indirectly own common stock in
many companies. An index fund is a mutual fund that mimics a benchmark - like investing int he stock
market as a whole (investing in all public companies). They also have lower fees because managers
don't do the work to pick stocks.

# Building a Common Stock Portfolio

The simplest approach to diversifying your stock market investments is to invest in one index fund
that represents the entire stock market. You can also divide stock holdings into three groups:

* large company stocks
* small company stocks
* international stocks

You can build a stock portfolio with three index funds that represent these benchmarks. Doing this
will take diversification one step further. You can also customize based on your risk tolerance.
Smaller companies provide an opportunity for increased returns but large company stocks provide less
volatility and more income from dividends.

You can take diversification one step further with six index funds for your stock allocation:

* large company
* large company value
* small company
* small company value
* international
* REITS (real estate investment trusts)

It's important to rebalance your portfolio to respect your diversification. One fund may do better
than another over a year, but it will eventually revert to the mean.

# My Favorite Piece of Pie

The biggest piece of the investment pie is compounding. From 1978 to 2007, a $10,000 investment in
the stock market average would grow to $386,140. 40% was due to stock prices rising. The other 60%
was due to reinvestments of dividends.

Dividends are the profits that a company shares each quarter to its shareholders. Most companies do
so (but not all). Recipients can take this as a check or reinvest by buying more shares.

# Saving It

This entire book is useless if we can't strike a balance between saving and spending. We should be
fully aware of how much we should be saving to reach our financial goals.

At the same time, we shouldn't be scared by the retirement goal. Having a multimillion-dollar amount
might scare some people into delaying their financial planning. This shouldn't happen.

It's not worth making your life miserable today so you can retire in style tomorrow. Strike a
balance!

# Life, Logic, and Paradoxes

The less time you spend trying to learn everything about stocks, bonds, and mutual funds - the
better off you are.

But you need to know a few things. You need to know how expenses and taxes will affect your
portfolio. The less you pay in expenses and taxes, the better off you are. That's it!

Schulteis warns us not to pay managers large fees for sophisticated funds.

# Travels of a Coffeehouse Investor

When is enough enough? You can keep chasing higher returns, but at some point you'll have to stop
the researching and stick to your plan.

A company's stock price is not determined by the company itself; it's determined by the emotions of
investors who buy/sell the company's stock. There's no connection between the financial fortunes of
a company and its stock price.

Anyone's success at beating the market is more attributable to luck than stock-picking skill.

So do you stay put with a stock, or continually switch it for the next "hot" stock pick? Schulteis
suggests you buy and hold your index funds and let time do its thing.

# Spending It

Establish a financial plan and make adjustments along the way. The asset allocation you choose today
may not be the same as you near your retirement. As the stock market fluctuates, you'll want to
rebalance your portfolio to make sure your allocation is intact.

Keep track of your burn rate. Are you spending your financial resources in a way that reflects why
you worked so hard to save it? When you keep track of it, you can figure out how much money you'll
need when you retire.

# Index Funds and Beyond

The secret to building a successful common-stock portfolio isn't to "beat the stock market" over the
next two years, it is to capture the entire return over the next two decades. That's why index funds
are great vehicles for the coffeehouse investor.

Schulteis says the most revolutionary product surrounding index funds are ETFs or exchange-traded
index funds. ETFs are shares of interest in index mutual funds and are bought/sold throughout the
day on stock exchanges. Traditional index funds are bought/sold once a day.

Bonds and other fixed income investments can play an important role in your portfolio by reducing
risk and generating income during retirement years.

# Let's Have Some Fun

When you're working hard each day to save money, you owe it to yourself **not** to have fun by
playing the stock market. Look for fun somewhere else - don't gamble your money.

Schulteis invests in individual stocks himself - but he advises not do invest more than 5 to 15
percent of your total portfolio this way. At year end, compare your stock picks with the stock
market average. This will give you some appreciation of index funds.

# The Journey Continues

The purpose of The New Coffeehouse Investor is to help you get on with your life by introducing
these three guidelines (again!):

1. Don't put all your eggs in one basket
2. There is no such thing as a free lunch (use index funds)
3. Save for a rainy day

Build wealth, ignore Wall Street, and get on with your life. Good luck!
