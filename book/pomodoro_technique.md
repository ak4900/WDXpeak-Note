# The Pomodoro Technique

Francesco Cirillo walks us through his Pomodoro Technique in this official guide.

## Context

The goal of the Pomodoro Technique is to provide a simple process for improving productivity by:

* alleviating anxiety
* enhancing focus and concentration
* cutting down interruptions
* increasing awareness
* boost motivation and keep it constant
* refine estimation
* improve work process

The main tool used is time-boxing.

## Material and Method

There are five stages which usually last one working day/shift:

1. Plan at the start of the day to decide on the day's activities.
2. Track throughout the day to gather raw data and metrics.
3. Record, process, and visualize at the end of the day to learn.

You'll need the following materials:

* a kitchen timer
* a To Do Today Sheet
* an Activity Inventory Sheet (activities are noted here as they come up)
* a Records Sheet to record raw data

There are five objectives:

1. Find out how much effort an activity requires
2. Cut down on interruptions
3. Estimate the effort for activities
4. Make the Pomodoro more effective
5. Setup a timetable

Objective 1: Find out how much effort an activity requires. Use a Pomodoro as the unit of time - one
Pomodoro is 25 minutes long plus a 5-minute break. At the beginning of the day, move tasks from the
Activity Inventory Sheet to the To Do Today Sheet.

Start a Pomodoro. When time is up, mark an X next to the task. Each X signifies one Pomodoro spent
on the task. You can't fit multiple tasks into a single Pomodoro and you cannot extend the minutes
in a Pomodoro. Every four Pomodori, take a longer break. When the task is finished - cross it off.
If you finish before the Pomodoro is over - practice over-learning. At the end of the day, make
notes in your Records Sheet (# of Pomodori for types of tasks, interruptions, # of Pomodori total,
etc...)

Objective 2: Cut down on interruptions. Make them clearly visible by recording them down. Intensify
your focus during Pomodori.

Objective 3: Estimate the effort for activities. By recording interruptions and number of Pomodori,
you'll get better at estimating. Write down your estimates when you assemble the To Do Today Sheet.
Make note of the difference between estimates and actual time.

Objective 4: Make the Pomodoro more effective. Spend the first 3-5 minutes reviewing what you've
done in the last Pomodoro and getting an overview of what you will do. Spend the last 3-5 minutes
quickly reviewing what you've done.

Objective 5: Set up a timetable. Define and respect the timetable. Limits help you do concrete
things and motivate you because of concrete deadlines. It sets clear time-boxes. It measures the
results of the day. An example timetable looks like: 8:30-1:00 / 2:00-5:30.

## Results

The common length of a Pomodoro is 25 minutes, but this can be changed. It must be atomic. 20 to 45
minute intervals are best.

The length of a break depends on how tired you are. It also sets the rhythm that you work with.

The Pomodoro Technique keeps you focused on the task at hand, instead of always thinking in the past
or future. Instead of thinking how much more productive you'll be tomorrow - just do the work now
during this current Pomodoro session.

The bird's eye view actions are important. It's important to plan out your day, review at the end of
the day, and see how off your estimates are.

Don't use this technique for activities you do in your free time. This is only useful for goal
oriented activities.

## Conclusions

Time-boxing generates positive tension, allowing you to focus and do better work. Estimations help
breaks up complexity. If it lasts more than 5-7 Pomodori, you should break it down. If it lasts less
than 1 Pomodoro, you should add more to it. The scheduled breaks in between intervals helps you from
getting too burnt out. The observation and continual feedback will improve your productivity over
time.
