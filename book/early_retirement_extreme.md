# Early Retirement Extreme

Early Retirement Extreme by Jacob Lund Fisker is a philosophical and practical guide to financial
independence. Fisker is a polymath: physics researcher, investor, programmer, writer, minimalist,
and financially independent. In this book, he'll tell you his philosophies on life and how he
reached retirement at an early age.

Financial independence advice boils down to increasing income and decreasing expenses. Most advice
is heavily weighted on increasing income. This book tips the scale on reducing expenses. It's not
for everyone, but I found there's a lot of pieces of great advice that's applicable.

# A Different Frame of Mind

Fisker starts with an allegory of Plato's Cave. In this cave, prisoners have been arranged in a row
since childhood. They're chained so they can't move. They have neck braces, so they can only look
forward. Behind them is a fire, so they can see their own shadows on the wall. They can freely speak
to each other.

The prisoner's world is just shadows - they think they are the shadows and their friends are
shadows.

One prisoner breaks free and sees the world outside. He comes back and tries to convince his friends
to join him. He tells them there's more to the world than just shadows. These prisoners have a hard
time believing him and prefer to stay where they are.

# The Lock In

Life in the 1st world countries have become like Plato's Cave. Everyone is expected to go to school,
get a degree, work 9-5 to afford a mortgage + consume, then retire at an old age.

Fisker argues that a lot of effort goes into spending money. Spending becomes a reward for your hard
work. On top of it, the harder you work the more you're taxed.

Society has encouraged us to become specialists - locking us into a specific job. While being a
generalist is useful, it doesn't fit well into the existing system. We're just cogs in one giant
machine. Unfortunately, we're such efficient cogs that our production is amazing. With large
production comes large marketing and large consuming.

We have a choice to stop over-consuming. If you stop, you can afford to retire at a much earlier
age. This is what Fisker did. He managed to drop his expenses to 10k-12k/year. After 5 years of work
as a post-doc, he saved enough money to retire. He got out of the "rat race".

Fisker presents three pillars:

* Reduce waste and increase efficiency. This lets you live with the same benefits while eliminating
  spending.
* Have significantly reduced expenses and invest the difference in production.
* Find something meaningful to do besides work.

# Economic Degrees of Freedom

A society that worships conformity has zero apparent degrees of freedom.

    +-----------+-------------+-----------------+
    |           | tight       | loose           | // coupling
    +-----------+-------------+-----------------+
    | linear    | salary man  | working man     |
    +-----------+-----------------+-------------+
    | nonlinear | businessman | renaissance man |
    +-----------+-----------------+-------------+
      // organization

Coupling is a measure of a person's dependence on the world. Linearity limits degrees of freedom
because of its dependence on steps. For example, a business that sells widgets A and B is less
likely to fail than a business that sells widget A and A-extender.

Salary men are specialized wage earners who earn money from one source. They are very dependent on
the company they work for. They have very little control over their careers.

The working man doesn't collect a salary, his income is uncertain. He usually has an emergency fund.
The consumer pattern is still similar to a salary man.

The business man also has unreliable income - but is very dependent to his customers and business.
He can't just take off at the spur-of-a-moment for a vacation.

The renaissance man has a generalized skill set and multiple sources of income. The income may be
unreliable, but he's not dependent on a company or customers.

# The Renaissance Ideal

A renaissance man is also known as a universal man, polymath, or jack of all trades. When the term
first came into existence, human knowledge was still relatively small so a dedicated person could
eventually master different fields of knowledge. Thanks to an immense amount of effort spent on
research, it's hard to master even one field. Instead, Fisker argues we should try to become
competent in a range of fields. Just try to constantly improve what you know and explore new useful
areas.

The fields a person should focus fall into seven groups:

* physiological => obtain optimal levels of physical/mental health, know about healthy
  diets/exercises and maintain them, basic first aid and other emergency knowledge
* economical => learn basics of economics, finance, investing, balancing books
* intellectual => learn to learn, critical analyzing, research skills
* emotional => not waste resources, appraise value, strong character
* social => get to know people outside of profession, learn to sell, network, and politics
* technical => knowledge of services are useful to save money, working understanding of
  technologies, learn common trades
* ecological => food, growing food, cooking, etc...

# Strategy, Tactics, and Guiding Principles

When you're learning new skills, it's important to have these goals:

* become less dependent on a single source of income
* become less dependent on a multitude of store services

Here's a short list of suggestions:

* hair cutting
* mending clothes
* cooking
* trading (buying used or swapping)
* public transportation instead of car
* borrow from library instead of purchasing books
* gardening for food
* making simple, non-toxic household agents
* bicycle, motorcycle, or car maintenance

Learning via projects is a great way to start. Just avoid projects that cost money. It's best to
work on projects that earn money or projects that are "free" or save money.

# A Renaissance Lifestyle

Some guidelines:

* reduce wants/needs from marketplace to minimum
* decrease volume/size but increase sophistication of activities/possessions
* measure prosperity by less activity (do fewer useless things)
* work for the purpose of earning money for no more than five years
* avoid generating waste
* use system in your advantage (don't be evil!)
* serve yourself instead of having others serve you
* keep running costs low but pay for value
* maintain health
* build up capital to live as a capitalist
* always have the skills to find a new job just in case
* focus on developing skills rather than passive entertainment
* gain maximum in satisfaction with minimum expenditure of money/energy

## Things

They cost money, take up space, require maintenance, and are hard to get rid of. Own things that are
**needed**, durable, and preferably small. Things usually depreciate over time, take this into
account. Don't give into buying things you want for pure entertainment - make sure you really need
it.

Avoid getting new things unless required and get rid of existing things unless required,

## Shelter

The two most important qualities of shelter are location and price. It must be close to your job (if
you're working) and a grocery store. Preferably within walking distance so you can give up a car. It
must be cheap.

## Clothes

Get durable clothes that's flexible for all occasions. Dress more compatible with the weather to
save money on trying to change with the temperature. Learn to mend your clothes. Make your own
detergent.

## Health

Health is the wealth that matters the most. Fisker recommends we stay active and fit. He recommends
we have a high deductible, low premium health insurance plan and stay fit so we'll only use it for
emergencies.

Fisker mentions the warrior diet - eating one large meal a day. There have been some studies that
have shown intermittent fasting prolongs your life.

Eat out less! Learn to cook your own food. Learn which meals can be made cheap and healthy. Optimize
your ingredients.

## Transportation

Minimize the distance you need to travel. Cars should be for recreational use. Use them on weekends
for tours and use your feet for weekdays. If you must have a car, learn how to maintain/repair it
yourself. Cars are depreciating assets, buy one to get your from point A to B (not as a status
symbol!)

## Services

What's "necessary" in modern times weren't available just a few decades ago. Do you really need the
TV, cell phone, and other services you pay for? Evaluate them to save some extra money.

Getting rid of TV also has the benefit of getting additional time. Fisker hates TV - it prevents
people from learning. Instead, workers just vegetate in front of it after a full day of work.

Some services to think about:

* television
* cell phone
* internet
* credit cards
* insurance (low premium, high deductible for emergencies!)

## People

"If I can't identify with a job title, like assistant sales manager, who am I really?"

Radically changing your lifestyle will get some negative criticisms your way. Just ignore it. Don't
try to keep up with the jonses.

A lot of people say it'd be easier if they were single. Technically, it's not true. It's easier to
have two people earning incomes and sharing a household than trying to do it alone! There's no
secret here, just plain old compromise.

# Foundations of Economics and Finance

The wage earner's cash flow looks like this:

    stuff -> you -> wage (loops back to stuff)

It can be even worse when introducing debt:

    stuff -> you -> wage -> debt (loops back to stuff)

To become independent, you'll need to develop an emergency fund because income will become
unreliable. You'll also need to spend far less than what you typically spend.

A typical recommended savings rate is 10%. For every 9 years of work, you'll have enough money saved
up to cover 1 year of not working. What if you could save 50%? For every 1 year of work, you can
cover 1 year of not working. Now tip the scale in the other direction - 80% savings rate. For every
2 years of work, you can take 8 years off. This is how early retirement is reached.

Fisker recommends we learn to invest our money so we can survive on the interest earned from our
savings.

When you purchase an item or maintain a monthly/annual expense, try to think of the amount you need
saved to cover it. For example, that daily cup of coffee costs ~40/month or ~480/year. Assuming a
very conservative 4% interest from your savings:

    0.04 * X = 480
    X = $12,000

You'll need to save an additional $12,000 for retirement to maintain the $40/mo expense.
