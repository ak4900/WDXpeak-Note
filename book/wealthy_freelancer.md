# The Wealthy Freelancer

By Steve Slaunwhite, Ed Gandia, and Pete Savage. This guide has 12 pragmatic tips on how to become a
better freelancer. For the authors, wealthy is defined differently depending on the freelancer -
whether that means more money, more time, more control, or more freedom. It usually involves getting
the big four:

1. Projects you want
2. Clients you want
3. Income you want
4. Lifestyle you want

# 1. Master the Mental Game

In the face of difficulty, **goals will guide you through the storm**. Setting goals works, so write
them down and you'll be more likely to succeed. Do this:

1. Envision ideal day
2. Compare and create ideal and current days
3. Prioritize tasks and execute

The author recommends creating a set of standards, rules to live by for your freelance business to
move you towards your ideals. An example:

* I do not provide spec work
* I charge 25% premium on rush jobs
* I do not begin work without 50% project fee deposit
* I do not work on weekends
* I do not answer the phone every time it rings
* I only work within my target industry and niche
* I only accept projects where my hourly earnings are $150/hour or higher

Living by your standards means you'll feel within control. You control your business, not your
clients. Acknowledge obstacles and consciously decide that they won't stop you.

# 2. Simplify the Process of Getting Clients

The authors' Master Marketing Formula:

1. Find high probability prospects
2. Generate leads
3. Get opportunities
4. Close the sale
5. Nurture "not today" prospects

# 3. Create Your Amazing Buzz Piece

A buzz piece is a valuable information piece, usually in the form of a special report or guide,
that's easily downloaded. Create one and use it to establish yourself as an expert and to land
clients. Some examples:

1. A photographer might create "7 Strategies for Scheduling Busy Executives for a Photo Shoot"
2. A plumber might create "How to Find Leaks BEFORE Water Damage"
3. A marketer might create "The Web Marketing Toolkit"

Hand out your buzz piece instead of business cards. Use it when pitching to potential clients as a
freebie. Use it to market yourself on your website.

Buzz pieces must be related to what you do and prospects must want the information in it. It has to
be valuable.

# 4. Employ High-Impact Prospecting Tactics

There are four quadrants for prospecting tactics.

1. Converts well and takes little time
2. Converts well but takes more time
3. Converts poorly but takes little time
4. Converts poorly and takes more time

You want to stay with tactics in quadrants #1 and #2. You can pick a few out of quadrant #3, but
choose wisely. Avoid quadrant #4. Examples are:

1. Use existing network, ask existing clients for more work, direct mail
2. Networking events, social media, public speaking, article writing, blogging, e-newsletter, cold
   calling
3. PPC ads, SEO, online job boards, advertising
4. Unfocused networking, unfocused mail, unfocused social media

Always remember to offer value first. Give a talk at a local meetup with valuable content,
prospective clients will find you. Tweet out valuable content, more prospective clients will follow
you. Blog valuable articles, prospective clients will subscribe to your blog.

# 5. Cultivate Repeat and Referral Business

Repeat and referral business means your business comes to you.

First, make sure your clients know all of the services you offer. This can be as simple as listing
out your specific services on your website. For example, instead of just "copywriting", the author
does: Sales Letters, Direct-Mail Packages, E-Mail Marketing Campaigns, Newsletters and
E-Newsletters, Landing Pages, etc... Existing clients will know that they can re-use you for another
task.

Make a fee schedule - a two-column document listing out your services and a fee or fee range.

Happy clients want to give you additional work. To make sure clients are happy:

1. Be a joy to work with.
2. Be professional.
3. Deliver outstanding work.
4. Be flexible.
5. Thank clients frequently.

# 6. Nurture Prospects Perpetually

By staying in touch with prospects, you'll stay on their radar and become the first person they
think of when they require a service. These prospects are part of the "Not Today" crowd. They don't
require your services now, but will later on.

**What's missing? Timing and trust.**

To fix this, you can stay in touch with them with value-added messages. Consider a mailing list that
delivers free and valuable materials over time. Or a blog that this crowd can subscribe to.

Content to create includes:

1. Articles you've written
2. Reports or white papers
3. Success stories
4. Third-party content
5. Books
6. Press releases
7. New services
8. Event invitations
9. Videos and podcasts
10. Helpful tools

# 7. Price Your Services for Success

The authors suggest pricing by project instead of by hourly rate for several reasons:

1. Pricing by hour tends to signal that you're a commodity
2. Pricing by project means you can price by value delivered
3. When you give an hourly rate, you have to give a project estimate anyways
4. An hourly rate means the faster/better you get, the less you get paid
5. No need to track time with project-based pricing
6. Hourly rate means income is limited

There are exceptions. If the scope is too unclear, you may need to bill hourly until the scope is
better understood.

Project pricing means you'll have to clearly explain your policy regarding: meetings, revisions,
changes, scope creep, and more. Otherwise you risk being paid less than minimum wage.

Create a fee schedule - a document that lists services with corresponding fees. Example:

* Website - Front Page, $750 to $1,250
* Website - Bio Page, $250 to $500 per bio
* Website - Services Page, $500 to $750 per description
* E-Mail - Newsletter, $750 to $1,500 per issue
* E-Mail - Announcement, $500 to $1,000
* Blog Ghostwriting, $500 per post

The fee range gives wiggle room. Make sure to price in the professional range, not in the bargain
basement range.

Remember that clients are hiring you for results. A renovation contractor isn't being paid for the
price to glue 78 tiles in place, they're being paid for a shiny new floor. The better you position
your services around results for clients, the more likely you'll get the job with a good price.
Always ask the client exactly what this project is trying to accomplish:

* What exactly do you need this press release to accomplish?
* How many leads are you hoping this direct-mail letter will generate for your sales force?
* What do you need this e-mail newsletter to accomplish for your company?
* What are you hoping this new logo design will do for your organization?

Don't lower your price because it signals to clients that it's easy to always get a lower price from
you. You can always negotiate:

* offer to get the job done faster
* throw in an extra freebie
* offer a discount for paying in advance
* ask for more time to get the project done
* offer volume discount

# 8. Bring Focus to Your Freelance Business

Determine your area of focus. Without focus:

* You'll often have to verbally explain what you do.
* Marketing is harder.
* Income becomes more sporadic.
* You'll accept any work that comes in.
* Quality of clients is all over the map.
* "Everyone" is a prospect.

To figure out your focus, use the DIP technique:

1. Discover what you can offer. What exactly do you bring to the table?
2. Identify the market. Do the companies in this market need your service?
3. Position yourself in that market.

# 9. Boost Your Productivity - Without Perspiration!

This chapter is full of productivity tips:

* Consider getting an office.
* Schedule working hours and stick to them.
* Use 50-minute focus sessions, similar to the Pomodoro technique.
* Use a muse for inspiration.
* Give projects some incubation time.
* Hire out and outsource work.

# 10. Construct Your Own Work-Life Reality

Freelancers can create their own work-life reality that fits our unique circumstances.

Everyone has their own unique view on what "Work-Life Balance" really is. This may mean a strong
separation of work/life, or it might mean an easy flow between the two. It may mean a rigid 40 hour
work week schedule or a more flexible some weeks 20 hours, other weeks 40 hours.

Recall your ideal day and paint a picture of what a balanced day looks like. Some tips:

1. Discover when you do your best work and schedule it in.
2. Try getting away from work and taking a break once in a while. Does it help?
3. Use your finite amount of time wisely.
4. Start each project right away.
5. Outsource menial work.
6. Train clients to respect your time. Don't sent emails outside non-business hours. Don't answer
   phones calls outside non-business hours.
7. Exercise!

# 11. Create Alternative Streams of Income

There's a limit to how much income a freelance can make the traditional way. You can raise the
ceiling using passive income. Some tips:

* Pay attention to what you're already doing for free, start charging for it.
* Outsource work to get it done faster or cheaper.
* Create information products and sell them.
* Use affiliate programs.
* Start teaching your expertise.

# 12. Live and Work in the Wealthy Triangle

The authors show us a time-income curve which are inversely correlated. Earning more money means
less free time. Freeing up more time means earning less money.

The Wealthy Triangle you should aim for yields a good amount of income without taking up all of your
time.

**Don't just make a living. Design a fulfilling and meaningful life.** Do this by:

1. Lay a solid financial foundation with your freelance business.
2. Figure out your ideal time-income spot on the curve.
3. Figure out what to do with your spare time: travel, volunteer, spend time with family, improve
   physical health, improve emotional health, make a difference, etc...
