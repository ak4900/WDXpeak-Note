## Domains of life - prokes vs euks

What's required to be considered life?

* metabolism (respiration)
* reproduction
* response to environmental stimuli
* subject to evolutionary adaptations

Cells adhere to all four qualities. Cells can be divided into two categories: **prokaryotes** and
**eukaryotes**. Prokaryotes are made up of bacteria and archaebacteria. Archaebacteria can grow in
extreme environment like the ocean floor or acidic places.

Viruses are not considered living. They can't metabolize or reproduce on their own. In this class,
we'll focus on eukaryotic cells. The widely accepted theory is that prokaryotic cells are ancestors
of eukaryotic.

Let's do a comparison:

* phospholipids membrane - both have it
* cytoplasm/ribosome - both have it, prokes have smaller ribosomes
* genetic material/code - both have it (DNA/RNA)
* size - prokes are 1-10 micrometers, euks are 10x larger at 30-50 micrometers. The largest
  eukaryote is the human egg at 100 micrometers.
* single vs multi - prokes are mostly single cell communities. Eukes are multicellular mostly.
* cell wall - prokes have a peptidoglycan cell wall. Eukes don't, except for plants which have
  cellulose fungi.
* organelles - prokes don't have them, eukes do.
* cytoskeleton - prokes don't have them, eukes do.
* genome organization/structure - prokes have a single circular chromosome. Eukes have a linear DNA
  complex wrapped around histones.
* division - prokes do binary fission and eukes do mitosis.

## Eukaryotic organelles

* nucleus - houses chromosomes, handles gene expression
* nucleolus - ribosomal RNA transcribed here
* endoplasmic reticulum - abbreviated ER. There's smooth an drough. Continguous with nuclear
  membrane. Rough region studded with ribosomes. Proteins destined for secretion are made here at
  RER.
* golgi - proteins get tagged by molecules and sorted for delivery
* lysosome - digestive organelle
* mitochondria - metabolic powerhouse, ATP synthesized here. Plants have chloroplasts
* cytoskeleton - structural integrity, organization of organelles, movement of organelles and whole
  cells

## Evolutionary origins

The origin of earth is about 4.6 billion years ago. The first known cell based on fossil is about
3.5 billion years ago and was a prokaryote.

2.7 billion years ago, photosynthesis increases concentration of oxygen. First eukaryoteic cell
evidence found to be 2.1 billion years ago in fossils.

200,000 years ago the first humans appear.

Mitochondria/chloroplasts could have originally been prokaryotes. Evidence:

* both mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA
* their DNA is circular genome
* both encased by double membranes
* they replicate independently of the cell by binary fission
* they have their own ribosomes (about same size as bacteria's)

## Cell culture and fractination

Let's go through how to retrieve cells:

1. centrifuge to separate cells in blood
2. tissues are more tedious, use enzymes to chop it up
3. put in culture plate/flask, set in incubator for growth with right environment
4. primary culture are first cells from sample, passage them to fresh culture plate
5. cell grows until it reaches edges, to continue you'll need to passage them to a fresh plate

The **Hayflick Limit** says that cells will reproduce to a certain amount before they stop
reproducing (about 50 times). DNA has **telomeres** at the caps and with each synthesis the
telemeres get smaller due to DNA polymerase. Then they **senesce** or die. Stem cells, cancer cells,
and bacteria cells don't have this problem. They have a telomerase protein which refills telomeres
or their genome is circular. Cancer cells are useful for biology labs, but have their own
abnormalities.

**Flow Cytometrey** or **FACS Fluorescent Actuated Cell Sorting** is a powerful technique to sort
cells:

1. break cells with ultrasound
2. separate out sub-cellular structures with centrifuge
3. velocity sedimentation for more separation
4. equilibrium sedimentation (plasmid vs chromosonal DNA)

## Overview of protein purification

Some techniques are:

* column chromotography via ion-exchange, gel-filtration, or affinity
* SDS gel electrophoresis
* x-ray crystallography, figure protein structure requires biophysicist expert

## Microscopy

**Microscopy** is a power means for studying cells. With the naked eye, we can see 1cm to
7100micrometers (largest single cell). With a light microscope, we can see 1mm to 100nm (nucleus,
bacteria, no organelles). With an electron microscope, we can see 1nm to 0.1nm (an atom).

* details are enhanced when you stain cells via bright-field microscopy, but the cells die after
  being stained
* dark-field microscopy requires no staining but has less details
* phase contrast gets details without staining, takes advantage of waves in contrast to brighten up
  image
* differential-interference contrast allows 3d images, useful to study cells in real-time

**Fluorescent Microscopy** involves tagging cells with fluorescent marker either outside or inside
the cell. USually requires activation. Immunofluorescence uses antibodies.

**Green Fluorescent Protein or GFP** is a protein found in jellyfish used to tag cells now. You can
use it to study gene expression at transcriptional level. You transfect cells with the GFP DNA
sequence after your coding region. Your cell will create the protein with GFP attached which will
glow green.

**Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer or FRET** lets you study protein interaction within a cell.
Photoactivation fluoresces a small portion of the cell and lets you follow movement.

**Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching or FRAP** lets you find the diffusion rate of protein on
membrane by photobleaching a portion and waiting for it to recover.

Electron microscope introduced in 1950's, specimen has to be very thin, dead, stained with metallic
chemical. It's very expensive and requires a highly skilled technician. The scanning electron
microscope shoots electrons from the side.

# Lecture #2: Membranes

## Overview: Functions & Fluid Mosaic Model

Why are membranes important?

1. Defines boundaries of the cell (defines boundaries for organelles for eukaryotes). The boundary
   of the cell is called **plasma membrane**.
2. Handles transport of what goes in/out.
3. Handles signaling/communication between cells. Even for prokaryotes, they use it to find food.
4. Acts as anchoring site for cytoskeleton and to extracellular matrix.

The **fluid-mosaic model** is the currently accepted model and describes the mosaic of the membrane
(lipid molecule + protein molecule + lipid bilayer). The phospholipid is not static, they're highly
mobile (think olive oil). It's highly likely to have lateral diffusion of lipids. It's unfavorable
energy wise for the lipds to flip-flop vertically - it happens but very rarely. The fatty acid tails
of the lipids is what gives it the oily feel.

## Phospholipids

Membrane is made of phospholipid bilayer. Head is hydrophillic, attracted to H20. Tail is
hydrophobic, repelled by water. Each layer is called a **leaflet**. The lipid bilayer is 5nm thick.

One tail is saturated (rigid and straight), the other one has a double bond which introduces a kink.
The head is composed of a choline, phosphate, and glycerol in this particular one. There are many
different types of phospholipids.

Phosphatidyl-serine actually has a net negative charge. Some are derived from glycerol.

Cholesterol has hydrocarbon ring and chain (acts as tail). The head has a little bit of polarity.
The cholesterol orients itself in between two phospholipids. This makes it more stable, the more the
phospholipids are packed the more stiff the fluidity is.

How membranes form: phospholipids mixed with water fill spontaneously form a bi-layer. The bi-layer
will turn in on itself and form a sphere. It's the most energetically favorable formation.

**Liposomes** are these bi-layer spheres that are used in pharmaceutics. They're packed with
chemicals for drug delivery into a cell.

There are different domains within plasma membrane itself. **Lipid rafts** are more dense and packed
with cholesterol. They're like packs of butter floating on oil. Some argue that it's more like heavy
cream mixed with light cream.

Glycolipids are scattered on the outer leaflet, carbohydrates are on the outer membrane. The
negatively charged heads point inwards towards the cell.

## Membrane Proteins

There are **transmembrane proteins** that traverse through the membrane. Some coil through th
emembrane one time (single pass membrane protein or integral membrane protein). Some coil multiple
times (multiple pass), some have a barrel shape. Some coil within one leaflet but doesn't go fully
through.

**Peripheral proteins** surround the membrane but don't go through it.

The function of these proteins are:

1. Tunnel proteins for traffic
2. Signaling in the form of receptors or signal tranducers
3. Anchoring for cytoskeleton or extra-cellular matrix
4. Cell-cell interactions (adhesion molecules)
5. Intracellular traffic
6. Metabolic functions (mitochondria/chloroplast have inner membranes with elaborate electron
   transport chains)

Since core of membrane is hydrophobic, the amino acid that associate with the core are typically of
hydrophobic nature. You can do a hydropathy plot based on the hydrophobic-ness of each amino acid.
If a hydrophobic portion is long enough, you can predict if the protein will be a membrane protein.

Most cells have protein on the outside that are heavily glycosylated (they're covered in protein).
They're translated then modified to have sugar added to them. The sugars are added on in a
post-translational modification.

**Glycocalyx** is what you see when you stain the cell that surrounds it. It's a good cushion for
the cell membrane. It doesn't impede the fluidity/movement, but it provides protection.

Break apart the cell and add detergent. Detergents are **amphipathic** - part hydrophilic, part
hydrophobic. This interrupts the bi-layer to separate the phospholipids from the proteins.

A classic experiment fused a mouse cell and human cell. Antibodies were added with fluorescents.
Initially, one half of the cell is green and the other is red. After ~40 minutes, red/green are all
mixed up. This shows membrane fluidity.

**FRAP** - fluorescent recovery after photo-bleaching. Can be used to follow the diffusion of
protein within the membrane. Bleach a single area to get rid of fluorescence, then watch as it
diffuses.

**FLIP** - fluorescent lost in photo-bleaching. Continuous radiation in one area. Keep bleaching it,
see how long it takes for all fluorescence to go away.

## Traffic of Small Molecules Across Membranes

Keep in mind that the bulk of the membrane is hydrophobic (at top and bottom). This has a big impact
of movements of small molecules in/out of cell. Creates a hierarchy of molecules - some can easily
move across, others need assitance.

* small hydrophobic molecules, non-polar, electrons shared equally like oxygen, carbon dioxide,
  nitrogen, steroid hormones. Easily moves in/out without assitance.
* small uncharged polar molecules like water, urea, glycerol. They have an easy time moving in but
  sometimes require assistance. **Aquaporins** are channels that the water can move through.
* large uncharged polar molecules require assistance like glucose/sucrose
* ions are heavily repelled by membrane

This property of membrane is called **differential permeability** - not all things can penetrate the
membrane equally.

Going back to chemistry - **diffusion** movement of a substance down its concentration gradient.
Going from high concentration to low concentration.

**Osmosis** is a special case of diffusion, movement of water across a semi-permeable membrane from
high to low concentration.

Substances that have difficulty crossing the membrane require assistance from transport proteins. It
could bind to a integral protein, the protein will fold, and then release it across the membrane.

Some different forms of transport:

* simple diffusion
* passive transport/facilitated diffusion => channel mediated or transporter mediated. Passive means
  the solute is moving down its concentration
* active transport requires energy since it's moving against diffusion

In addition to concentration gradient, we have to consider the electric gradient if the solute is
charged. For a typical cell, the inside is negatively charged compared to the outside.

The energy from active transport can come from ATP or light pumps. There's also coupled transport
(2+ solutes moving in/out at the same time). The energy of one solute moving provides the energy for
the second solute moving. For example, sodium coming with its gradient can give energy to glucose
moving out against its gradient.

There are different types of ATP driven transports:

* ABC transporter (biggest family), have two ATP binding sites. 50 members that exist in prokaryotes
  and eukaryotes.
* F-type (and V-type) proton pump
* P-type pump

Cystic fibrosis is caused because the ABC transporter protein mis-folds causing a lot of muccus
build up in the lungs.

An example of the P-type pump: sodium potassium pump that all animal cells have. It requires
hydrolysis of ATP on cytoplasmic domain of the pump. The ATP provides the energy to pump the sodium
out. Three sodium ions are pumped out of the cell followed by two potassium ions pulled in. This
contributes to a net-negative charge inside the cell.

The typical animal cell spends about a third of its ATP reserve on this pump. There's a poison
called oiban that disables the pump when it binds to it (the pump has a site specifically for it).
Cells treated with it eventually burst.

Plant cells have cell walls which love getting plump with water. Animal cells will burst if water
keeps rushing in. This will happen when there are too many ions within the cell. The osmotic balance
is regulated by using the sodium potassium pump.

The three main reasons the sodium-potassium pump is important:

1. osmatic balance so animal cells don't burst
2. provides the sodium/potassium gradient for other proteins to do co-transport
3. differential charge created (positive outside, negative inside) creates a membrane potential.
   Important for nerve signaling propagation of stimulus

Besides pumps, there are also channels:

* voltage-gated, a change in polarity signals opening of gate
* ligand-gated (extracellular ligand), opens in response to binding of a factor like
  neuro-transmitter
* ligand-gated (intracellular ligand), the factor comes from inside the cell as opposed to outside
  of the cell
* mechanically gated, based on changes in cytoskeleton that can alter conformation

## Action Potentials and Nerve Impulses

If there's equal charges on both sides of the membrane, the membrane potential is said to be equal
to zero. If there's a charge differential, we say there is a **membrane potential** that occurs.
Ions will move towards the opposite polarity. If a channel is open, ions would move.

The sodium-potassium pump was important for nerve impulses. Nerves have a cell body, dendrites, an
axon (1mm to more than 1m), and terminal branches of axon. Nerve impulses move in one direction
(dendrites to axon terminal). At the tips of dendrites are ligand channels.

The sodium-potassium pump has established a gradient so outside is more positive relative to inside.
The membrane potential is at -70mV (**resting potential**) when the channel is closed. When it hits
+50mV it's an **action potential** due to sodium ions moving. Sodium gates don't stay open
indefinitely and the potential moves back to resting.

You get a wave of polarity changes that move down the length of the axon.

Axons are covered with a **myelin sheath** which is composed of structural cells called schwan
cells. It's layered on top of the axon and used for insulation so action potential isn't reached
(otherwise the propogation would be too slow). There are gaps along the axon called **nodes of
Ranvier** (where the sheath doesn't wrap), these places have action potential occuring. Each sheath
wraps about ~1mm in width. Damage to myelin sheath could cause paralysis.

# Lecture #3: Intracellular Compartments/Traffic

## Overview of Intracellular Compartments

Oragnelles of a eukaryotic cell:

* nucleus
* endoplasmic reticulum rough/smooth
* golgi apparatus
* mitiochondrion
* lysosome
* cytosol
* endosome
* perixosome
* free polyribosomes
* ribosomes

Cell needs efficient way of shuttling proteins around. Eukaryotes need an efficient way to pack the
organelles (it's 1000x size of prokaryotes).

Some proteins are translated in the free riding ribosomes in the cytoplasm, others are translated at
lysosome. Proteins destined for secretion or placement into plasma membrane go through RER (rough
endoplasmic reticulum).

## Nuclear Transport

Let's look into movement of proteins between cytosol/cytoplasm and nucleus. This occurs via a "gated
transport" mechanism. The nuclear pores act as the gates.

The nuclear membrane is continuous with the ER (it takes up about 10% of the cell volume, it's
huge). A typical mammalian nucleus has 2k-3k pores. The inner nuclear membrane is a mesh, the
strongest of cytoskeletons. It breaks down during mitosis and enables the chromosome to separate. It
reforms in daughter cells.

There are ~30 proteins that make up nuclear pores. They have a diameter of about 9nm diameter. Small
molecules can move in and out, anything larger needs active transport (most proteins and mRNA are
too big).

Import sequences are encoded on the genome. Proteins destined for the nucleus will have a **nuclear
localization signal**. Receptors exist that bind to the signal and enables them to move into the
nucleus. This is fueled by GTP bound to a protein called "Ran". Ran-GTP provides energy. The
receptors move in and out of the nucleus, transporting molecules and recyclying the GTP energy.

Some example proteins: DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase, histones, transcription factors.

## Protein Translocation

Movement of cytoplasm to mitochondria/ER/plastids/peroxisomes occur by **protein translocation**.
Signal sequences are consensus amino acid sequences that tell the protein where to go (import into
nucleus, export from nucleus, import into mitochondria, import into plastid, import into
peroxisomes, import into ER, return to ER).

Mitochondria have two membranes, the inner is highly folded. It's responsible for the electron
transport chain which is responsible for the huge bursts of ATP. The folds are called "Cristae".
There's a need to get proteins into the mitochondria. Mitochondria has its own circular chromosome
(human is about ~16kb, 37 genes, 13 responsible for electron transport chain, 22 encode tRNAase, 2
genes code for ribosomal RNAs) and have about 2-10 copies of its genomes.

Proteins are freely translated in the cytoplasm. There's a signal sequence to import into
mitochondria (at N-terminus) that binds to receptor of outer membrane called TOM (translocator outer
membrane). Enzymes need to be delivered into the matrix for Kreb's cycle. Enzymes unfold as it moves
through the outer membrane, then it moves through the inner membrane. Finally, the signal sequence
gets cleaved off by peptidase.

Polypeptides go through a similar complex when they're destined for the endoplasmic reticulum. The
polypeptide will have a signal sequence that binds to an SRP protein. The polypeptide will still be
with a free ribosome. The SRP protein pulls it down to the ER where it binds to an SRP receptor
protein (essentially "docking" the ribosome onto the ER). A protein translocator on the ER will help
translate the protein and let it through the ER membrane. The SRP leaves and gets recycled.

## Vesicular Transport

Movement between ER and golgi (and golgi with everything else) occurs via **vesicular transport**.
Think of a lava lamp except proteins that pull the vesicles around - giving direction.

Protein translated in RER, moves towards golgi (processing/sorting of protein), and gets sent to
lysosome or to the plasma membrane.

**Exocytosis** - particle leaves the cell and leaves its membrane as part of the cell membrane.
**Endocytosis** - particles come in and takes a piece of the cell membrane.

The ER is not static, the membranes expand/contracts and moves. It's about 10% of the total cell
volume. There's a smooth and rough region, the regions are contiguous.

Smooth ER is not associated with ribosomes, it is associated with lipid metabolism.

Let's think about a multipass transmembrane protein. There are multiple start and stop signal
sequences. Each one specifies which portion of the protein stays outside or inside the membrane.

Proteins synthesized in ER pinch off and fuse with the membrane, eventually ending up at the Golgi.
The Golgi is made up of stacks. The cis FACE is oriented towards the nucleus. The trans FACE is
oriented towards the cell membrane (?). As proteins move through Golgi, they're modified by a
variety of enzymes.

The ER glycocylates the protein which is very important for its folding. Improper foldings of
proteins can lead to aggregation of hydrophobic regions, dangerous for the cell. There are
**chaperone proteins** that help with folding and checking of proteins. Misfolded proteins are sent
out and tagged with **ubiquitin** which is a signal for it to be destroyed. The destruction happens
in the cytosol's **proteasome**. **ER stress** occurs when there's too much unfolded protein in the
ER, which signals to the cell that it should die. Bottom line, ER is very picky about folding status
of proteins.

**Secretory Pathway** - protein originates on the ER. Vesicles pinch off carrying the cargo protein.
Moves through golgi apparatus where it's modified (glycocylates the protein). From there, it gets
sent to the right place.

Vesicles on the ER are covered with COPII protein, on the cisternae of golgi are called COPI.
Proteins destined to depart are called cargo. As the proteins leave, the vesicle covers it
completely as a coating. As it travels the coating eventually falls off and form vesicular tubular
clusters before getting to the cis Golgi network.

Vesicles are directed to go to a particular membrane. It carries a hair-like protein called a
**snare**. v-SNARE stands for vesicular snare. There are also **Rab** protein. These act as decision
makers for where the cargo goes. The Rab binds to a counterpart tethering protein on the target
membrane and enables docking. The v-SNARE comes together with t-SNARE on the target membrane. The
vesicle fuses and the cargo gets delivered to the membrane.

Some ribosomes are free in the cytoplasm, others are bound to the ER. It comes from a common pool in
the cytoplasm. The commitment comes from the mRNA that happens to hook up with the ribosome at that
particular time. If mRNA codes for cytoplasmic protein or protein destined for membrane, it won't go
to the ER. If it has an ER signal sequence at N-terminus, it tells the ribosome to go to ER. There's
a receptor that binds to the mRNA/ribosome and pulls it down to the ER as it's translated. As
translation continues, the protein gets pushed down into the ER. A peptidase will cleave off the
signal sequence. The mature polypeptide chain will eventually move to the Golgi.

What about plasma proteins? There's a 20-30 amino acid domain appropriate for sitting in the
membrane. It depends on the hydropathy of the amino acids. The 20-30 amino acid is interpreted as a
"stop" as in stop once it hits the middle of the membrane. Peptidase cuts off signal sequence.

Once cargo proteins hit the trans Golgi network, it's properly modified and folded. Some are spit
out, others stay there. The ones that leave get placed into a vesicle. Proteins destined to leave
the cell have their vesicles fuse with the membrane and the cargo leaves. Proteins that are destined
to fuse with the cell membrane are fused into the vesicle membrane. When the vesicle fuses with the
cell membrane, it ends up being a transmembrane protein. Secretory vesicles store secretory proteins
and wait for a signal (from hormones or nerves for example).

Let's look at the converse of the secretory pathway - cell brining large molecules in. Collectively,
the process is called **endocytosis**. The subsets are:

* phagocytosis - bringing in of largest molecules
* pinocytosis - bringing in smaller substances
* receptor mediated endocytosis

They all involve vesicle formation, degredation in lysosomes. Ultimately the substances pulled in
will fuse with the lysosome and get digested.

**Autophagy** is a process to recycle old organelles. Membranes would form around the aging
organelle, it then fuses with the lysosome which digests it.

The **endosome** organelle is the first to receive endocytosis particles. It has a low pH causing it
to break apart the cargo from its vehicle. It eventually makes its way to the lysosome to be broken
down.

The **lysosome** is a membrane bound organelle loaded with damaging enzymes: nucleases, proteases,
glycosidases, lipases, phosphatases, sulfatases, phospholipases. Any living material will be
destroyed. Lysosomes have a hydrogen pump that uses active transport to bring the pH down to ~5.0
compared to the cytosol's pH of ~7.2. The damaging enzymes (acid hydrolases) are only folded at this
low pH. If it were to leak, the hydrolases would denature and become inactive outside of the
lysosome.

**Phagocytosis** requires the cell to send out pseudopods and actin proteins. Actin proteins can put
pressure on cell membrane which pushes the membrane out, enabling it to engulf whatever it's trying
to bring in. Single-cell organisms use it as a means of eating.

Let's look at **receptor mediated endocytosis**. On the surface is a receptor. The cargo binds to
the receptor. Adaptor proteins enable recruitment of clathrin and beings adapting the membrane
shape. As clathrin accumlates around the pit, a vesicle forms (gets pulled into cytoplasm). Once the
vesicle is nearly formed, dynamin protein wraps around the neck of the vesicle and pulls tight,
removing the neck. The vesicle travels into the cytoplasm. Clathrin breaks off. The best studied
example is of LDL particles. Clathrin isn't the only game in town to create vesicles, there are
other proteins like caveolin which create structures called caveolae.

Viruses usually enter cells by endocytosis. We learn a lot about endocytosis through virology. An
example that uses receptor mediated endocytosis is HIV.

# Lecture #4: Cytoskeleton, Cellular Adhesion and ECM

## Cytoskeleton Overview

The overall function of the cytoskeleton:

* stability
* shape
* framework, enables organization internally
* enables movement (whole cell movement, muscular contractions, vesicular transport)

Microtubules emanate out of the nucleus. Microfilaments are disperesed all around the microtubulues.
Microfilaments are composed of actin/ATP. Microtubules are composed of an alphabeta-Tubulin dimer.
They're slightly larger but also flexible. Intermediate filaments are made up of various different
proteins. These are the most rigid of the cytoskeletal elements and form a rope-like structure.

## Microfilament

Microfilaments are made of actin, the most abundant protein in the cell. It's flexible, linear
bundles, forms 2d networks. Dispersed throughout the cell, concentrated in the cortext. Highly
dynamic, polarized, myosin motors. Used for cellular shape and mobility; vesicle transport; muscular
contraction.

Microfilaments are vital for cells to creep along a surface. The instability of microfilaments (they
can break off and fill up) allows the cell to move by pushing on the membrane. A **filopodia**
structure are like feet formed from the microfilmanets pushing against the membrane. **Stress
fibers** contract and expand the cell, moving it like a worm.

The single actin monomer has an ATP binding site. When ATP binds, it has a tendency to bind with
another monomer - which will have a tendency to bind with another. This accelerates to eventually
become a chain.

Microfilaments are highly unstable. They can quickly polymerize and depolymerize. Some have caps
anre remain stable (like for skeletal muscle).

As the filament builds, the ATP is hydrolized to ADP. The frontend has actin bound ATP, the backend
has actin bound to ADP. The backend is losing monomers while the frontend builds them up. If there's
a steady state, then it won't change size.

This is called **treadmilling** and it also provides some movement to the fiber. There's protrusion
in the frontend and contraction in the backend.

There are severing proteins that contribute to the instability structure. Branches start to grow and
a network forms and pushes on the cell membrane to move. Notice that treadmilling doesn't involve
motor proteins.

There's a class of motor proteins based on **myosin**. Originally we thought they only existed in
muscular cells. Later it was found in amoeba, which became named myosin II (for two heads). After
that, it was just named in the order it was discovered. There are 40 different myosin genes in the
human genome, 9 expressed in inner ear that enable hearing via movement of hairlike cilia.

There are three classes of myosin with different functions:

1. associated with membrane, endocytosis
2. contraction
3. vesicular transport

Myosin-II wrap along itself and form a fiber. Contractile/stress fibers form bundles. As the bundle
gets pulled together, it contracts creating movement.

Let's look through the basic anatomy of a cellular muscle:

* muscle made up of bundle of muscle fibers
* each muscle fiber is a single cell (multi-nucleated where it did not split apart during mitosis)
* inside a single muslce fiber are myofibrils (kind of compartments)
* also inside are cytoplasm, mitochondria, and a specialized ER called the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
* all of them surround a single myofibril

Let's look inside the myofibril:

* composed of single filament that's capped
* in between each set is a myosin filament
* the subunit of a myofibril is called a single sarcomere
* sacromere acts as the contracting unit of the muscle

Action potential depolarizes T-tubule membrane and allows calcium to flow through cytosol of muscle
fiber and bind to gated channel sensitive to calcium ions. The gate opens and the calcium stored in
sarcoplasmic reticulum flows out into the cytosol of muscle cell.

## Microtubules

Microtubules made of alphabeta-tubulin/GTP. More rigid than actin filaments, single long straight
tubes. Less dispersed; emanate from central region of cell. Highly dynamic, polarized, associated
with kinesin/dynein motors. Used for organization and transport of organelles and vesicles. Used as
a spindle apparatus during mitosis.

They play important roles in interphase (not actively dividing) and mitosis. They emanate from the
**MOTC microtubule organizing complex** also known as the **centrosome**. The negative end as at the
centrosome. The same concept of treadmilling holds. Microtubule dynamics are at the positive end -
an instability built into them. During mitosis, a spindle apparatus develops. They're important for
chromosomes during mitosis and microfilament assembly. They're associated with kinesin and dynein
motor proteins which drive movement that's sensitive to the polarity of microtubulues.

Kinesin moves towards positive end, dynein moves towards negative end.

The tubulin protein builds microtubulues and is a heterodimer made of alpha and beta-tubulin. Beta
will be on top (positive on top) and alpha will be on bottom (negative on bottom). GTP acts like a
structural entity, the alpha-tubulin holds on pretty tight to it. The tubulin monomers build up to
form the microtubule.

The beta subunit associated with the GTP is important to the dynamicness, the GTP goes through
hydrolases. GTP hydrolysis weakens bond and the tubule tends to de-polymerize. The subunits fall off
the positive end (as opposed to microfilaments). Microtubules act like a stack, microfilaments are a
queue. This is referred to as **dynamic instability**.

Let's consider the role of microtubules in terms of organization and centrosome. The centrosome is
near the nucleus and the microtubules emanate from it. It's constantly growing/shrinking. Some seek
capping proteins at cell membrane to be more stable (called seek and capture) so not all of them are
constantly falling back on themselves.

At the center of the centrosome are a pair of protein structures called **centrioles** (not present
in plant cells). There's an amorphous region that surrounds the centrioles which act as anchoring
sites for microtubules to nucleate. These anchoring sites are composed of rings of gamma-tubulin.

Motor proteins are dynein and kinesin that physically walk down the tubule. These look like
creatures walking, similar to atlas holding a globe. It's important for movement of organelles and
vesicles along the rafters provided by the microtubules. A kinesin can hand off a vesicle to a
myosin motor protein on the microfilament as it gets toward the cytoplasm.

## Intermediate Filaments

Intermediate filaments are made of various proteins. They're rope-like and most rigid of them all.
They're found in the nucleus and across cytoplasm. Less dynamic and unpolarized. Not associated with
motor proteins. Used for cell and tissue integrity to give strength acting as anchors.

Present in all animal cells but plants don't have them. There are five classes, four is cytosolic
and the fifth is associated with the nucleus. Keratins associated with epithelial. Desmin, GFAP,
vimentin with muscle cells. Neurofilaments with neurons. Lamins with nucleus. What they all have in
common is strength. It's a key different, they're much stronger than microfilament and microtubules
but much less dynamic. They don't associate with any nucleotide and have no polarity.

They form filaments that curl into a rope-like structure. There's an amino terminus and carboxyl
terminus. The monomer forms into a dimer, then forms into a tetramer, two tetramers pack together,
ultimately eight tetramers curl to form a rope-like filament (10 nm) with 32 monomers in a
cross-section.

They're cross-linked with microtubules and microfilaments. The rope-like property makes it bendable
without breaking easily. Cells are fragile (olive oil coating and microfilaments/tubules that are
unstable/dynamic). Intermediate filaments provide strength and integrity to sheet of cells in a
tissue. **Junctions** and **adhesion molecules** connect the cells together via intermediate
filaments, creating a strong sheet of cells. If you pull, the cells remain intact as opposed to
rupturing.

The nucleus has a nuclear lamina which is a meshed like basket of intermediate filaments.

## Extra Cellular Matrix, Junctions, Adhesion Molecules

Let's think about the various types of tissues that exist in the vertebrate body. Now we're thinking
about multicellular organisms:

* muscular tissue => movement
* nervous tissue => signal transmission of nervous system
* epithelial => body surfaces; cavities of body tissue (eg gastral intestinal tract, respiratory
  tract, urogenital tracts, glands of organs)
* connective => bind and support others, fibroblast cells

The epithelial cells are sitting on top of a basal lamina (extracellular matrix that supports it).
Underneath is connective tissue composed of collagen fibers and variety of other proteins and
carbohydrate structures giving great strength to the organism.

There are four major interactions between cells:

* anchoring junctions - placement and stability
* occluding junctions - prevent movement of substances from on side of cell down to another side
  (important for gastrointestinal tract cells)
* channel-forming junctions - pores allow for free diffusion of substances between two neighboring
  cells
* signal relaying junctions - looks like synapse

We're going to focus on anchoring junctions. There are different classifications based on whether or
not junction is associated with basal lamina and also depends on which cytoskeletal elements are
involved. Does it involve microfilament or intermediate filament. Is it cell to cell or cell to
matrix:

* desmosome
* adherens
* hemidesmosome
* actin-linked cell-matrix adhesion

[See cell junction/classifications table in slides.]

Different classes of adhesion molecules: involved in homophilic vs heterophilic interactions.
Cadherins are major class of cell-cell interactions (homophilic binding). Vertebrates have 23
separate genes encoding different types of cadherins. There are five domains that are repeated,
stability is based on presence of calcium ions. Immunoglobolin-superfamily plays an important role
in the immune system (homphilic binding). Integrins are heterophilic, mammals have gene for 15
alphas and 8 betas. They have a variety of affinities, in this example is for extracellular matrix
structure fibronectin. Selectins are important in circulation (heterophilic) have an affinity for
sugar.

Microfilaments also contribute to integrity of tissue.

We'll use the example of epitheliol cells (?). They're anchored to a basal lamina via adhesion
molecules and hemidesmosomes. On the inside are intermediate filaments anchored to the desmosomes.
Desmosomes can also connect cells to their neighbors (via their neighbor's desmosomes).
Microfilaments are dispersed throughout the cell.

The **extracellular matrix** is a mesh of various proteins and carbohydrates. Poking up through the
membranes are the integrins anchoring the cell. Adherins contributes to signaling into the cell to
let it know it's in a stable place.

# Lecture #5: Cell-Cell Communication

## Overview: Receptors and Signal Transducers

There are 32 trillion cells in the average adult human. They live in dynamic association with each
other. It's important to know when to grow, when not to grow, when to die, when to differentiate.
It's the state of **homeostasis** where you maintain your body's environment.

The cells need to communicate with each other: is it time to survive, grow and divide,
differentiate, or die? This is done with **signaling ligands** and **receptors** on cells.

         receptor
    (CELL)-( o <-- signaling ligand

You can group ligand/receptor interactions into four classes:

* contact-dependent - direct contact of cells, ligand is membrane-bound
* paracrine - one signaling cell secreting the ligand, having an effect on nearby cells. There's no
  direct contact (synaptic usually involves adhesion)
* synaptic - transmission of nerve signal, secretion of neurotransmitter to nearby cell
* endocrine - endocrine cell secretes hormones that move great distances (eg bloodstream) and
  activate on far away target cells

Any individual cell can express a variety of receptors. Estimated human cell expressed 10 to
100,000s different receptors. It's determined by differentiated cellular function.

The general strategy: ligand binds to receptor. Signal gets relayed from one molecule to the next
(intracellular signaling molecules). It could be by changing conformation of protein or various
post-translational modification like phosphorylation or exchanging GTP with GDP. They eventually
reach effector molecules, which will alter metabolism or gene expression or cell shape/movement. All
together, it's called a **signal transduction pathway**.

How long does it take? If the end result (effector structure) does not require activation of gene
can be within less than a second to minutes. Ligand inducing cells to move would happen in seconds.
If the end result is activation of new genes, there's more of a delay ~ minutes to hours. At the
end, you get altered cell behavior.

The two major classes: cell-surface receptors (see diagram above), ligand is typically hydrophillic
molecule. Intracellular receptors - signaling molecules are hydrophobic and carried via varrier
proteins. Signal molecule diffuses through the plasma membrane and the receptor is an intracellular
protein. Classic example is the steroid based hormone. Only cells with cytosolic receptors will
respond.

The cell surface receptors have different families:

* ion-channel-coupled receptors - eg movement across membranes. Sensitive to action potential or ion
  changes.
* g-protein-coupled receptors - largest class of receptors ~700 different types in humans. Receptor
  is a multipass transmembrane protein and couples with membrane bound G protein (complexes with GDP
  or GTP). G protein is inactive without bound receptor, bound receptor will activate the G protein
  and activate an enzyme that leads to cascade of effects.
* enzyme-coupled receptors - cytoplasmic domains have enzymatic activity, usually kinase.

Most pathways aren't simply linear. Most branch and reconnect, you get a very complicated web with
all sorts of opportunities to amplify/modulating signals.

Let's go through some themes for the hand-off steps in the relay process. What mechanisms are
invokved during the relay race?

* signaling by phosphorylation - signal transducing molecule, adding a phosphate group changes the
  protein into an active conformation. 34% of cellular responses involve phosphorylation. ATP -> ADP
* signaling by gtp-binding - inactive when associated with GDP, active when bound to GTP. Hydrolysis
  removes the phosphate. GEF = guanine exchange factors.

Specialized type of phospholipid are phosphatidylinositol (PI). Specialized kinase PI kinase can add
phosphate groups to hydrophillic end of phospholipid. It can do this sequentially. This provides a
mechanism for signaling into cell.

There's also a signaling mechanism that involves second messengers. Cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP (cAMP and
cGMP), Diacylglyceral (DAG). cAMP derived from ATP depends on active form of enzyme adenylyl
cyclase. It's involved in a variety of signaling mechanisms like thryoid hormone synthesis and
secretion.

## G Protein Coupled Receptors

It's a 7 pass transmembrane protein. Inactive when not bound to hormone. Trimeric G protein is
composed of three units and associates with GDP (alpha, beta, gamme subunits). There's an inactive
effector enzyme dependent on activation of G protein. Binding of hormone induces conformational
change in receptor. Receptor binds to Galpha subunit, releasing the GDP, exchanged for GTP. With
GTP, the alpha unit can bind with effector and activates it. Ultimately, it goes back to inactive
form. [see slide]

An example of an activated effector is an adenylyl cyclase which contributes to cyclic AMP which
contributes to activated PKA. The PKA moves into nucleus and phsophorylates transcription factors
previously inactive.

## RTK Receptor Tyrosine Kinases

Well studied class of signaling receptors. Humans have about ~60 different RTKs: eg EGF receptor,
IGF1, NGF, PDGF, MCSF, FGF, VEGF, Eph receptors. What they all have in common is that their
cytoplasmic domain is associated with tyrosine kinase domain. Example responses: stimulate cell
survival, growth, proliferation, or differentiation.

Classic scenario is the binding of ligand will activate receptor and activate tyrosine kinase
activity. Receptor will cross phosphorylate for downstream effects. Four types of epidermal
receptors that were well studied are the human epidermal growth factor receptor or
Her1/Her2/Her3/Her4. They're responsive to a variety of ligands. To be active, they must form
dimers. HER1 can partner with HER1 or HER2. HER2 can partner with HER3 or HER4. HER2 has no active
ligand binding domain. HER3 has a defective active kinase domain. HER2 is over-expressed in 30% of
breast cancer cases, target of Genentech's drug. HER1 is over-expressed in a variety of cancers and
became a target in a variety of cancer drugs.

Sevenless was a mutated fruit fly with abnormalities in its eyes. Sevenless fruit fly encodes a cell
surface receptor that was found to be homologous to EGF receptors. Another sevenless fly was found,
but the gene affecting it was different. They called it son of sevenless (SOS). SOS defection was
later found out to be at a guanine exchange factor (GEF) and the target of the GEF was a protein
called Ras. Ras is a protein that's abherrently regulated in a type of cancer found in rats. In
sevenless, the ligand on the surface of the R8 cell when binded activates tyrosine kinase which
leads to phosphorylation and leads to binding of Drk protein, which enables binding to Ras-GEF
(SOS), which works with Ras protein that holds GDP in inactive form. Ras-GEF exchanges GDP with GTP,
Ras is active and contributes to downstream signals. Human cells have a same theme downstream from
the HER. It's one of the most highly conserved signaling pathways.

RTK monomers, binding of ligands leads to dimerization. Kinase is now active and quickly
cross-phosphorylates. Tyrosine amino acids are phosphorylated. That enables for binding of GRB2
(equivalent to Drk). Notice that the nomenclature is a mess. Now the GRB2 binds to phosphorylated
receptors and Sos. There's an exchange of GDP for GTP and Ras becomes active and signals downstream.
Targets Raf and activates it. Raf is a kinase, once it's active it phosphorylates MEK (another
kinase). MEK phosphorylates MAP kinase (aka Erk or MAPK). MAP kinase is active and can move into
nucleus and contribute to activation of transcription factors. This is often called a
**phosphorylation cascade**. MAP stands for **mitogen activated protein**. A mitogen is a growth
factor that induces mitosis. RAS has a tangential pathway also, activating a PI3K [see slide 18b].
There's a lot of redundancy built in, different ways to get to the same effect.

## JAK/STAT Receptors

It's a much simpler signaling pathway to consider. Cytokine are communication signals important for
immune system, many of which invoke the JAK receptor. The receptors are dimers associated with a
kinase on cytoplasmic domain. JAK sits on the receptor via a non-covalent bond. JAK = janus kinase
(roman god with two faces). People joke and call it "just another kinase". Cytokine ligand binds
leads to activation of JAKs, phosphorylate each other and add phosphates on tail end of receptor.
Enables binding of STATs proteins (STAT = signal transducer activator transcription). STATs
disassociate and dimerize. Downstream leads to activation of transcription factors.

## Notch Receptors

Mutant that had a notch in its wing. Notch encodes an important receptor that's important for
development in wing and nerve cell in fruit flies. In humans, it's one of the most widely used
pathways in development.

Key elements to signaling are the notch receptors and ligdand called "delta". The end effect is the
binding of ligand communicates with notch receptors that the cell will NOT become a nerve cell (for
a nerve cell developing from an epitheliol cell).

Number 1 is a proteolytic enzyme which cuts the notch. The notch has a non-covalent binding that
gets delivered to the plasma membrane. Delta is on the surface of a neighboring cell and acts as a
ligand that binds to the notch. Cell swallows it up via endocytosis. Protease on extra-cellular side
of membrane cleaves off extra cellular portion of notch. Intra cellular protease cuts of cytoplasmic
domain of notch. The tail goes into nucleus and contributes to activation of gene transcription.

## Wnt Receptors (Wingless)

Wingless and hedgehog receptors are **morphogens**. They act during early stages of embryotic
development. This is accomplished via secreted proteins that diffuse constantly throughout the
embryo. Wnt and hedgehog are themselves the ligands.

The mutation of wnt receptors created wingless fruit flies. Let's go through the history. A group
was trying to figure out which wingless gene caused the wingless protein. Another group was studying
MMTV = mouse mammary tumor virus. It turned out that MTV integrates into the chromosome. The group
found that in the mammary cells that transformed into cancer cells, there was the MMTV genome
integrated into the chromosome. MMTV induced expression of a new gene. Sequencing the gene turned
out to be homologous to the wingless gene. They named it WNT for "Wingless Integration".

Wnt is equally important for stem cell proliferation. Mutations in the Wnt pathway have been found
in 90% of colon cancer cases.

## Hedgehog and NF.kB. Receptors

The fruit fly with the hedgehog mutation looked like a hedgehog, so the scientist decided to name it
hedgehog. There are three different types: sonic, desert, and indian.

When there's no hedgehog, the smoothened receptor is sequestered in vesicle of cytosol. Meanwhile,
Ci protein (humans have an equivalent Gli, associated with brain cancer) is anchored onto
microtubules and gets phosphorylated. The tail is cleaved, translocates into the nucleus and acts as
a repressive complex that keeps the hedgehog target gene turned off.

In the presence of hedgehog, it binds to the outside protein that gets internalized and degraded in
lysosome. Smoothened protein gets phosphorylated and enables the Ci on the microtubules. Enables
transcription of hedgehog genes.

## NFkB (cappa B)

NFkB is released with cytosine TNFa that binds to its receptor, leads to activation of IKK complex.
That phosphorylates the inhibitor of NFkB and triggers ubiquitylation and degradation of IkB. NFkB
translocates into the nucleus and triggers transcription of other genes.

# Lecture #6: Cell Division and Apoptosis

## Cell Division, Mitosis

Fundamental cell trait: cells come from other cells. Cells must faithfully replicate genetic
material to daughter cells. Important to think about on multicellular level. Several key processes
for homeostasis of organism in terms of number of cells:

* cell division
* cell death
* terminal differentiation - cells enter a state where they neither divide or die called G0

Cell cycle is (1) cell growth and chromosome replication, (2) chromosome segregation, (3) cell
division into two daughter cells.

When is and when is it not appropriate to go through cell division process? Embryonic,
growth/adolesence, healing, wound repair, repleneshment of vulnerable tissue. Some tissue rarely
divide: connective tissue like fibroblasts, nerve cells, muscle cells.

Interphase is the time between mitosis. There's growth of the cell and duplication of the DNA. The
duplicated chromosome held together by special proteins. Each individual chromosome is a chromatid.
The microtubules connect the chromosomes to a central point called the centromere. At the very end
of the M phase, there's a cytokinesis stage which is the breaking apart of the cell. It involves
myosin filaments and microfilaments that pull/pinch to form a contractile ring and eventually
separates out two daughter cells.

During interphase, the chromosomes aren't at their most condensed state. You wouldn't be able to see
individual chromosomes when looking at the nucleus. As the cell enters prophase, the chromosome
becomes highly condensed to the point where you could visualize distinct chromosomes. Meanwhile, out
in the cytosol the centrosome duplicate. The microtubules take on a spindle-like formation.

Prometaphase, the nuceleus diffuses. Nuclear lamina breaks down. Microtubules reach out towards
where the nucleus used to be. Some make contact with the chromosome - like a random "reach and
seek". The centrosomes move towards opposite poles of the cell. Spindle apparatus forms.

Metaphase, the spindle apparatus is fully formed. The chromosomes align down the center of the cell
called the metaphase plate.

During anaphase, the microtubules start to shrink and retract. The pull the sister chromatids to
opposite poles of the cell. Now each chromatid is a full chromosome.

Telophase, there's continued movement of chromatids towards opposite poles. The beginning of the
contractile ring forms, pinching in the cell membrane.

Cytokinesis, the pinching creates cleavage. Nuclear membrane begins to reform around both
chromosomes. There's two genetically identical daughter cells.

Interphase can be split into different steps:

* G1 phase (gap 1 phase), the cell prepares itself for division. Protein modifications, organelle
  growth, etc...
* S phase (synthesis) - DNA replication
* G2 phase (gap 2 phase)

M Phase is split into two steps: mitosis (nuclear division) and cytokinesis (cytoplasmic division).

For a human cell in culture, it takes about ~24 hours for a complete cell cycle. G1 takes about 6
hours, S phase about 10 hours, G2 phase about 5 hours, mitosis about 1 hour. Cells spend most of
their time in interphase, especially S phase - duplicating chromosomes and quality control of DNA.

Cells are responding to signals to determine if they should divide or not. For example, the
epitheliol track is exposed to EGF (growth factor) which signals the cell, goes through signal
transduction pathway, induces the cell to go into G1 phase.

## Cell Cycle Regulation, cyclins/CDK's

The heart of regulation of cell cycle comes down to cyclins and Cdk (cyclin dependent kinase).

Tim Hunt was studying sea urchin embryos. He was doing crude biochemistry protein studies, following
the mitotic events of embryotic development. He noted that a particular protein whose levels went
up/down depending on phase of division cycle. He identified the protein and discovered cyclin
(because the levels cycle).

Paul Nurse and Lee Hartwell did genetic studies on yeast mutants. Yeast are single cell eukaryotes
that have phases where they can diploid or haploid. They're well suited to genetic modifications.
They found temparture sensitive cell division cycle (CDC) mutants. Some of the proteins found in
yeast also cycled. There was a convergence of their research and Tim Hunt's research. CDC2 and CDC13
proteins played a key early role in cell division process. Turns out CDC2 is a kinase and CDC13 is
cyclin.

Cell receives signal from growth factor, this spurs expression of cyclin during G1 phase. That
complexes with inactive CDK, which activates it and enables it to go through S phase. At the end,
cycling occurs as G1 cyclin degrades. Due to activation events of S phase, there's a new set of
cyclins activating another set of CDKs. This drives the cell through mitosis. That cyclin then gets
degraded.

     Connect ends to form circle diagram:
     -------------------------==========-----------===
               G1                 S         G2      M
                        ^ restriction point

During G1, there's a build up of G1/S-cyclin. In humans this is called cyclinD and the CDK is called
CDK4 or CDK5. Ending G1 and starting S, there's cyclinE and CDK2. Through S, there's cyclinA and
CDK2. Through G2, there's CyclinB and CDK1.

If you put cells in a petri dish and provide nutrients without any growth factors, they won't
divide. They'll just hang out there. If you provide growth factors for ~10 minutes, they still won't
go through cell cycle. So how long do they need? They need the growth factors even during the G1
phase. There's a critical factor in there. In yeast, they call that the "start". Once they clicked
past the S phase, they can go all the way through without growth factors. In humans, we call it the
**restriction point**.

During mitosis, there's APC/C which mediates it. With presence of APC/C, the M-cyclin level drops
and there's the start of metaphase-anaphase.

Once CDK gets activated, it phosphorylates targets (it's a kinase). The target is Rb, which were
present in the G1 phase. Rb is active in a resting cell and is hanging on to a set of transcription
factors called E2F proteins. An activated G1-CDK will phosphorylate Rb, Rb releases its hold on E2F
transcription factor. E2F brings on S phase gene transcription. E2F promotes its own expression
(positive feedback loop). As G1/cyclinE and cyclinE are created, they phosphorylate more Rb
proteins.

During interphase initially, the origin of replication regions of chromosome are associated with set
of proteins called the origin recognition complex (ORC). As the cell progresses through G1, more
proteins are associated with it. The cell readies itself for DNA polymerase. During S phase, the
phosphorylation of ORC which S-CDK triggers will allow the binding of a preinitiation complex that
splits the DNA strands for synthesis.

Now we're in G2, the cyclinB and CDK1 reach a significant level. Sister chromatids bound by cohesion
complex that keeps the pair together. These cohesion proteins need to be broken down - regulated by
M-CDK proteins. Phosphorylation of APC/C lets it bind with CDC20, activates APC/C. There's an enzyme
called separase that binds with inhibitor called securing. Active APC/C ubiquitylates and degrades
the securin. Now the separase is an active protease that can break down the cohesion protein.

There are three different aspects to the spindle apparatus. There are centrosomes and microtubules.
The negative ends are anchored at the centrosomes. The astral microtubules have dynamic instability
pushing towards the plasma membrane. Others reach out towards where the nucleus once was, connecting
up to the kinetochore microtubules. Interpolar microtubules migrate in towards where the nucleus
once was, criss-cross over each other, but don't actually connect.

During Anaphase A, sister chromatids are being pulled apart because the microtubules begin to
shorten. Motor proteins pull on the structure as the microtubule experiences dynamic instability at
the kinetochore microtubules.

During Anaphase B, interpolar microtubules are lenghtening. They're criss crossing over each other,
contributing to the forcing of spreading of two daughter cells away from each other.

Not everything goes according to plan. Cells are equipped with checkpoints. At the start checkpoint
at G1, is the environment favorable? Check before entering S phase. Before entering mitosis (g2/M
checkpoint), is all DNA replicated and environment favorable?

During G1 phase, the extracellular environment must be favorable to make it to the restriction
point. Sensing signals from the outside make sure of this. If DNA damage occurs at any point during
G1 or S phase, the cell arrests and stops cell cycle. Unreplicated DNA or DNA damage will also cause
cell arrest. Chromosome unattached to spindle will also cause cell arrest.

Cell can detect DNA damage, for instance due to X-rays. ATM/ATR kinase can sense double strand
breaks. They're activated when the strand breaks, which phosphorylates and activates Chk1/Chk2 which
phosphorylates and prevents p53 protein from being destroyed (it's normally transcribed and
degraded). The regulatory protein is called Mdm2 which adds ubiquitin to p53 and gets degraded in
proteosome. Active p53 is a transcription factor that transcribes a wide variety of target gene,
amongst them is the p21 gene. P21 is a CDK inhibitor protein that occur in G1 and S phase. P21
arrests the cell cycle by inactivating G1/S-CDK complexes.

P53 can also sense if the cell is not obeying the rule of upstream signaling pathway. Myc is a
transcription factor that is normally upregulated downstream of standard signaling pathways. It
normally contributes to activation of G1-CDK. P53 is sensitive to the level of Myc, high level of
Myc will lead to p53 degradation which then leads to cell cycle arrest of apoptosis.

## Meiosis

Most eukaryotes are diploid (two copies of chromosomes). There are some examples of haploid
eukaryotes (yeast can go back and forth). To maintain a constant number of chromosomes, the gametes
need to have half the number of chromosomes. During fertilization, we go back to the normal number
of chromosomes.

Meiosis splits the diploid into haploids. Fertilization combines them and Mitosis brings the zygote
back into a full organism.

For humans, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes. Each pair has one maternal and one paternal. 22 are
autosomes, 1 pair is the sex chromosomes.

Mitosis goes through DNA replication (S phase), duplicated chromosomes line up on spindle, gets
pulled apart, and then you get diploid daughter cells. Meiosis is much more complicated, resulting
in four daughter cells. You start with DNA replication (meiotic S phase), they there are two rounds
of cellular division (meiosis 1 and meiosis 2). Homologous chromosomes pair up into a **bivalent**
or **tetrad**. This enables crossing over to occur forming a **chiasma**, where pieces of
chromosomes are swapped - recombination of genetic information occurs. During first anaphase, the
chromatids stay together but the homologs get separated. End of meiosis 1 has two daughter cells
with one set of duplicated chromosomes. In the next separation, the sister chromatids are pulled
apart followed by cytokinesis, ending up with four haploid gametes.

Meiosis also contributes to genetic diversity through mixing of chromosomes and crossing over of
genes.

That's how it works form sperm cells, but for eggs it's a little different. **Oogenesis** is female
egg development. During female development, a female develops all the eggs she will ever have. They
don't go all the way through meiosis, they go up to the primary oocyte where it's arrested in
prophase 1. Each month after a female reaches puberty, one oocyte will go a little further into the
cycle. At ovulation, a cell completes meiosis 1. It doesn't release two daughter cells. The
homologues are still associated via a polar body, the egg is hogging all the cytoplasm. It doesn't
break into two even cells, it just spits out the random set of chromosomes. It's then arrested in
meiosis
1. If it's not fertilized, it's left in that state. If it's fertilized with
a sperm, this signals the developing oocyte to continue into meiosis 2 which yields a second polar
body. There's ultimately a merging of chromosome of sperm and egg. The extra chromosoes (polar
bodies) eventually break down.

## Apoptosis, Overview of Cellular Events

Cell death is an important part of life for multicellular organisms. It's needed to regulate cell
numbers, organization of organism, and regulating aging tissue.

White blood cells have finite cell cycles. They will eventually undergo apoptosis and take
themselves out of commission.

Cells can die via apoptosis (programmed cell death) or necrosis (more of a messy death) where the
chromatin clumps up, organelles swell, disintegration and release of intracellular contents, brings
on inflammatary response.

Apoptosis involves mild convolution, chromatin segregation, and compaction condensation of
cytoplasm. Chromosomes break down in a regulated way. Nuclear fragmentation, blebbing (cells
break/bleb off into these apoptotic bodies). Finally there's phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies.

Apoptosis is also important during embryonic development. The paw of a mouse fetus will form due to
cell death allowing separation of appendenges. If there's an error in apoptosis, humans will get
connected fingers.

## Caspases

The heart of regulation comes down to controlling **caspase**, which are rich in cysteine amino
acid. They are aspartate protease. They cut other proteins at aspartate residues. They're generally
in an inactive form called procaspases. They have a low level of proteoactive activity. Upon
appropriate signaling, caspases are cleaved and become completely active. These can go on and cleave
other targets.

One molecule of active caspase will initiate activation of many other caspases. You get a pyramid.
Eventually, you'll get many molecules of executioner caspases that can cleave cytosolic protein and
nuclear lamin.

## Extrinsic vs Intrinsic Activation

What are the triggers of apoptosis? They can come from the outside or inside, extrinsic vs
intrinsic.

Let's start with extrinsic pathway of activation. The cell has a death receptor to sense a signal
from the outside - DD for Death Domain. There's a death inducing ligand that binds to the DD. Inside
are Pro-Caspase 8/10 initiators that bind to DD via DED for Death Effector Domain. Binding leads to
cleavage and activation of Caspase. Leads to executioner caspases and apoptosis.

All cells are equipped with innate ability to sense for internal damage. Cells going through cell
cycle with DNA damage can cause the cell to arrest. If the damage is irrepairable, the cell will
perform apoptosis. Mitochondria has cytochrome c around it and smac protein. Bcl-2 proteins (b cell
lymphoma) acts as an anti apoptotic protein. It puts the brakes on apoptosis. There are natural
inhibitors of apoptosis in place (IAP). DNA damage will lead to activation of p53, relays and
relieves Bcl-2. Signals release of cytochrome C, which contributes to caspase 9. Meanwhile, there's
release of Smac which inhibits the inhibitors of caspase 9. This leads to apoptosis.

Classic example of intrinsic cell death are cytotoxic T cells otherwise known as Tc cells. It's
important to the immune system. One of the key functions of these cells is to destroy diseased or
infected cells. For example, cells infected with viruses or cancer cells. Cytotoxic T cells can kill
the target with two different mechanisms.

Killer lymphocyte has Fas ligand on its surface. There's a counterpart receptor called Fas,
expressed on just about every cell. This is the death receptor. Binding of Fas ligand to Fas brings
about series of events that lead to apoptosis. FADD stands for fas associated death domain.

Some extrinsic ligands/receptors:

* Fas ligand and Fas (or CD95L and CD95)
* TNF and TNF receptor
* TRAIL family of proteins which stands for TNF related apoptosis inducing ligand. Their associated
  receptors are TRAIL receptors or TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2. They have other names DR4 and DR5 for death
  receptor.

These receptors are differentially expressed in cancer cells. Some research is being done to trigger
these receptors in more cancer cells.

Let's look at the intrinsic pathway. Stimulation comes from DNA damage or oxidative stress or ER
stress. What's key here is the Bcl2 family of proteins. There are about ~20 members of Bcl2 family.
Some are pro-apoptotic vs others that are anti-apoptotic. Balance of pro/anti determines if cell
goes on with apoptotic or not.

The scenario for a resting cell not about to go through apoptosis. The Bcl2 protein is active. BH123
is inactive at outer membrane of mitochondria. In the cytosol are IAPs keeping procaspases silent
that are spontaneously active.

Activation of intrinsic pathway will have an apoptotic stimulus that inactivates the Bcl2 protein.
This enables BH123 proteins to enable the release of mitochondrial proteins including cytochrome c
and anti-IAPs. Anti-IAPs block the IAPs. Release of cytochrome c allows activation and assembly of
the structure called apoptosome + caspase-9. This leads to activation of executioner caspase and
apoptosis.

Cells also have survival factors which blocks apoptosis. These facators tip the cell on the side of
being anti-apoptosis.

# Lecture #7: Stem Cells

## Embyology (Early Human Development)

Let's talk about fertilization briefly. The egg doesn't finish meiosis until after it's fertilized.
The egg is surrounded by very dense extracellular matrix called the zona pellucida. For the sperm to
penetrate, they have to go through a layer of granulosa cell and break through the zona pellucida.
Sperm has a tip called acrosomal vesicle with hydophobic enzymes which help break it up. The sperm
nucleus then enters in the egg and the egg membrane polarity changes which prevents any other sperm
to enter.

Inside the egg cytoplasm there's a nucleus that has already gone through the second meiotic
division. Once it's fertilized, it triggers the completion of meiosis. Eventually the nuclei will
fuse and the centrosomes will duplicate. This is followed by DNA synthesis, nuclear membrane
fragments, and the fertilized egg prepares for first mitotic division.

Let's go through what happens in those first five days. There's a two-cell, four-cell, eight-cell,
compacted morula stage in the first four days. Then you get blastocyst.

From two-cell to morula, these cells are referred to be **totipotent**, they have total potential to
form a whole individual. This is dependent on implantation in uterus due to a lack of
differentiation. The cells at this point haven't taken a commitment on any structure. They wouldn't
grow in a dish. Once you get to the blastocyst stage, there's an inner cell mass and hollowed out
ball. At this point, only cells of inner cell mass will contribute to structure of the baby. Cells
on outside will contribute to formation of the placenta and will not be part of the organism.

The inner cell mass of the blastocyst are called **pluripotent**, they contribute to the total
person but on their own they could not support the growth of the whole infant. These cells are the
embryonic stem cells.

## Stem Cell Basics

What are stem cells?

* capable of replicating itself forever, self renewing
* unspecialized "blank" cells
* capable of giving rise to specialized cell types by differentiation

Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent, capable of giving rise to virtually all cell types, capable of
sustained self renewal in culture, derived from 5 day old embryos. Stem cells can be cultured for
years and remain pluripotent. The blastocyst is about the size of Roosevelt's eye on the dime.

They can be coaxed into differentiating into cell types that you want.

Let's contrast it with Adult Stem Cells. We all have stem cells in our bodies, it's important for
renewal of tissues that age. Skin cells need to regularly repelenish themselves.

Adult stem cells are:

* multipotent
* somewhat already committed to a specific cell type
* capable of giving rise to a variety of cell types
* capable of sustaining limited self renewal in culture, but not as easily as embryonic stem cells
* present in adult tissues (e.g. bone marrow, skin, small intestines)

The top layer of the skin is dead. As you go underneath, there are living cells which are terminally
differentiated to be epidermis. Keep going underneath and there's stem cells at the dermis layer.
Stem cells provide source for renewing the structure.

## Therapeutic Potential

In theory, we should be able to transplant stem cells into tissue just like we transplant whole
organs. Stem cell research could give us clues into prevention and treatment of birth defects in
vitro. There's nothing new about the concept, just think about bone marrow transplant.

In bone marrow transplantation, there's a process called **hematopoiesis**. There's cell division
going on in bone marrow and cell differentiation via the multipotent hemopoietic stem cell.

Individuals with leukemia might undergo serious rounds of chemotherapy to obliterate the cancer
cells, then they seek a donor for hemopoietic stem cells. The stem cells should come from an
individual with a good genetic match. The match should be in HLA complex protein, predominate
surface proteins on all of our cells that are highly polymorphic.

Stem cells are low abundant in the bone marrow, maybe 1 in 10,000. Thawed stem cells from donor are
infused into the patient.

Let's talk about adult vs embryonic stem cells. There is some success with adult stem cells in
therapeutic ways, but it's limited. Adult stem cells are less controversial. They don't grow as
readily in culture. There is potential for autologous transfer. For example, if a woman is about to
go through breast cancer chemotherapy which might interfere with hematophoiesis. Some woman elect to
have their own bone marrow frozen to give it back to themselves later on. There's also a huge
movement in preserving the umbilical cord blood which is packed with adult stem cells. A child could
have their own in stock.

Advantages of embryonic stem cells: they're pluripotent and grow readily in culture. Cons are
they're not established yet, untested in humans, and controversial. There's a risk of forming tumors
called teratomas. It's not like a cancer in that it's invasive, but if they're not sufficiently
differentiated before transplanted they could form tumors that have different cell types. Another
con is no autologous transfer. The bottom line is there's still a lot we don't know.

## Challenges (Scientific and Other)

One way to get around autologous transfer is cloining. This hasn't worked in human stem cells yet.
You have an egg cell and donor cell, remove the nucleus from the donor cell, transplant it into the
egg, the egg has the genetic background of the donor cell. The scientific community thinks it won't
work because the genes of the donor cell have permanently shut off developmental genes.

Another challenge are the ethical hurdles. Is a fertilized egg a person? The embryonic stem cells we
get are from blastocyst, usually from 5 day old human embryos. Spare embryos left over from in-vitro
fertilization. Thousands in USA frozen in nitrogen, would be otherwise discarded.

Induced pluripotent stem cells is free of ethical controversies. It has developed in the last 5
years. It's possible to convert adult cells into pluripotent cells by exposing it to reprogramming
factors. The cells will turn back its own clock.

There are four key transcription factors that's transfected into the cell and reprogrammed backwards
(shown to work in mice). You have pluripotent stem cells and you inject them into blastocyst of
different genetic background. The organism that comes out are chimeric.

## Cellular Nature of Cancer

Predicted 40% of Americans will get a form of cancer. 20% will die because of cancer. It's because
we're living longer - it used to be infectious diseases that was a primary form of death. Heart
disease is still a major cause of death but we made major strides in it also.

Typical adult has 30 trillion cells and complex inter-dependence. In theory, any cell has potential
to become a cancer cell.

What is Cancer? Unchecked cell division originating with a single cell. It can take on many forms
(approx ~200 cell types, some more susceptibility to be cancerous especially cells that are
constantly dividing). You rarely hear about nerve cells becoming cancerous. All cancers are a malady
of genes.

The six hallmarks of cancer from Hanahan and Weinberg paper:

1. growth signal autonomy - cells don't necessary obey normal growth signals
2. evasion of inhibitory signals - ignores any signals that would turn cell division off
3. evasion of apoptosis - no longer obeys signal to tip it towards programmed cell death
4. immortality - cancer cells induce expression of telomerase
5. angiogenesis (solid tumors) - ability to promote outgrowth of blood vasculature so tumor can
   provide itself with oxygen and grow
6. invasion and metastasis - ability to invade neighboring tissues

Division of normal cells happens during fetal/embryonic development, infancy/childhood/adolescent
development, wound healing, continued replenishment of exposed surfaces, and continued replenishment
of blood cells (hematopoiesis).

How do normal cells behave in cultures against cancerous cells? Normal healthy cells in culture dish
will grow into a mono-layer. They don't pile up on each other, are sensitive to neighbors, and
eventually stop. Cancerous cells (referred to as transformed) don't care. They'll pile up over each
other (pile is called a focus), and forms a multi-layer.

Transformed cells also tend to look different - called **dysplasia**.

## Tumor Formation

Tumors mean a growth mass. Not all tumors are cancerous, there are benign and malignant. There are
two important characteristics of a cancerous tumors:

1. clonal
2. heterogeneous

Tumors are initiated from one cell. It divides and its progeny includes the mutation. One of the
childs have a second mutation and has a greater growth advantage. There's then a third mutation with
a greater growth advantage, causes it to be agressive and invasive.

The development of a tumor is a Darwinian process. There's constant surveillance intrinsic and
extrinsic to the cell. What wins out in the end is the survival of a particular cell type. Typical
cancers take years to develop before symptons.

Once a tumor reaches a large size, the cell at the center begins to starve. In a very large tumor,
most cells are starved and you get necrotic death. A successful tumor gets angiogenesis factors.

An important angiogenesis factor is VEGF for vascular endothelial growth factor. It's becoming a
high target factor for cancer therapies. Some tumors that have vascularized can no longer be removed
- it would cause the patient to bleed to death. Single cells that escaped from its tumor could
travel via the blood channels and become resident in other organs - we call it metastatic
development. Once a patient reaches this stage (stage #4) it becomes difficult to treat. Testicular
cancer, for example, responds well to chemotherapy.

What's the difference between benign tumor and malignant? Usually the benign tumor is captured in an
extracellular matrix. It's contained and localized. The cells don't have evidence of dysplasia.
Usually they're relatively innocuous and doesn't metastasize. They have a slow rate of growth. The
margins of the tumor are well defined.

For malignant tumors, margins are very poorly defined. They're invasive. They have a crab-like
appearance (hence the name cancer). Tumor cells extend into and destroy surrounding tissue, this is
why in surgery you grab the tissue around and you're always concerned about stray cancer cells.
Cells have dysplasia. They have erratic growth - slow to rapid, many numerous and abnormal mitotic
figures. Metastasis possible.

What causes cancerous tumors to happen? There are numerous possibilities:

* abnormality in production of hormone/growth factor
* defect in hormone/growth factor receptor
* errors in signal transduction pathway
* errors in cell cycle regulatione
* error in checkpoint control
* error in DNA repair
* error in apoptosis

In cancer tumors, it's usually a combination of those elements above. There continues to be debates
about how many different defects in cancer cells.

## Carcinogens

What causes cancer? We describe substances/circumstances that causes cancer as carcinogens. They
come in two forms: initiators and promoters. Initiators generally are mutagens - things that cause
mutations in DNA. Promoters are cell division inducers. Quite typically it's a combination of both
that drives progression to tumors.

It's hard to figure out carcinogens. It involves epidemiology - studying at a grand scale. There are
tons of factors. It's usually based on statistics and tendencies, they're no absolute but can point
you in a direction.

One of the best study on carcinogens is on the substances found in cigarettes. Prior to 1920s, lung
cancer was extremely rare and almost unheard of. There's a correlation with cigarette smoking over
time and the rise of lung cancer.

Someone developed a test to measure the mutanticity of a substance by testing it against cell
cultures. (Classic Aimes Test?)

Some other example carcinogens:

* mutagenizing chemicals like cigarette substances (initiators)
* radiation: UV, X-rays, radioactive substances (initiators)
* microbes: infectious micro-organisms, viruses (promoters, 10-15% of cancers)
* metabolites: role of food (initiators)
* hormones/growth factors (promoters)

A by product of metabolism are mutagens - free radical oxidants. Food with anti-oxidants are said to
be cancer preventing.

## Genetic Basis of Cancer

What are the genes that are the targets of these carcinogens?

1. oncogenes - genes stimulatory to cell division, called proto-oncogenes in the field when they're
   not defective. These are considered to be dominant mutations and can contribute to cellular
   transformation.
2. tumor suppressor genes - normal activity is to silence the cell from replicating. In order to
   provide a susceptibility, both copies of the gene needs to be taken out. Generally this involves
   mutations in both alleles and contributes to cellular transformation.
3. DNA repair genes - loss of function defects, usually used to repair errors in DNA. May influence
   cell proliferation by increasing odds of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.

Quite typically it's a combination of ocogenes and tumor suppressor genes in the cancer.

Oncogene mutations are gated functions. For example, you can have a deletion in a regulatory
sequence so there's a hyper amount produced. Some are activated by an amplifaction of a gene -
typical to breast cancer when HGF is overexpressed on the cells. Chromosome rearrangement is another
one.

Some examples of oncogenes: ras, raf, erbB, bcl-2.

Tumor suppressor genes, normal function is to inhibit replicating ability. One of the most popular
is p53. The function of p53 was to arrest cell cycle under circumstances of DNA damage. It's
sensitive to DNA damage and other significant cellular environment activity (telomere shortening,
hypoxia lack of oxygen). Rb is another one - it's critical to cell division. It holds back S phase.

Example of DNA repair genes is XP gene - used to repair dimers in skin. Patients with mutated XP
gene have skin cancer.

## Treatments

Standard treatments:

* surgery if tumor is small and in safe place
* radiation therapy - target tumor, causes double strand breaks in chromosome, hopefully tumor cells
  undergo apoptosis (some tumors are immune to this, for example cells with mutated p53).
* chemotherapy - came out by accident after WW1 studies, soldiers came back after experiencing
  chemical warfare and experienced shriveled lymph nodes. Scientists figured they can use it to
  fight cancer. Highly toxic, cytotoxic agents kills all rapidly growing cells. Nonselective, kills
  normal tissues also (bone marrow, GI tract, hair follicles, tissues undergoing repair).
* bone marrow transplantation for leukemia

Novel and future therapies:

* chemoprevention - involves avoiding carcinogens via agents that you ingest that blocks certain
  promoters
* immunotherapies
* small molecule targeted therapies
* anti-angiogenesis agents

Quick overview of immunotherapies - they come in different categories. Some are antibodies
specifically targeting cell surface structures like receptors that are over-expressed or molecules
specific to a cell type. These are injected and you hope they hone in selectively on cancer cells
and block proliferation by blocking a receptor (like HER-2). Or it can deliver a toxic poison that's
tagged to the antibody.

Herceptin is a big success story, used to treat 30% of breast cancer patients with over-expression
of HER2. Promotes ADCC, bringing on death to the cell.

Other categories of immunotherapies are cancer vaccines - convince cancer patient immune system to
turn and pay attention to the cancer.

Other novel therapies are based on small molecules, organic molecules that can be packaged in a pill
and swallowed. The goal is to identify a clear target, usually oncogenes that are over-active in
particular cancer cells. Gleevac validated this concept used on a type of leukemia that involved a
translocation between chromosomes 22 and 9. There's a breakpoint and swapping of genes creating a
small chromosome. There's a creation of fused Bcr/Abl gene. Abl is a kinase that gets over-activated
when breakpoint occurs. Gleevec is a small targeted inhibitor.

Drug developed to work on B-raf. This entered us into personalized medicine, where we develop drugs
specifically for your genetic defects (ie which oncogenes are overactive?).

What does the future hold?

* improved diagnostics - microarray technology + genomics + scans. We're very behing right now, we
  just look for lumps/bumps and go in for screens.
* humanized mabs
* cancer vaccines
* arsenal of specific small molecule agents
* selection of anti-angiogenesis agents
* combination therapies - cancer cells are highly mutagenic. You treat with one drug, you're fine
  for a while, then tumor grows back that's more resistant to the original drug. You need to attack
  from many different angles.
* pharmacogenetics - individualized therapy
* invasion/metastasis inhibitors
* prevention
