# Ultimate Guide to Link Building

Guide to build links to your website to increase traffic by Eric Ward.

## What Makes it Link Worthy

**Useful content gets linked.**

Make your site link worthy. A magic store can add searchable database of tricks, biographies of
magicians, glossary of magical terms, or directory of magicians. Add rich/relevant content to
generate links. Useful content gets linked, products don't.

## Link Building Campaign Design

Design a sustainable link building campaign so the links won't stop when the campaign ends:

1. What's working well for you already?
2. What are your business/marketing goals?
3. What are your linkable assets? (create some by searching "how do I" + your space)
4. What are link opportunities in your space? (find sites/blogs/forums in your space)
5. What are your available resources?

## Linkable Assets

**What kind of linkable assets can you create?** Make a list. Common linkable assets include:

* free apps/tools
* products/services to give away or donations/contests/review
* widgets, tools, images, data for publishers (infographics/research data)
* thought leaders and subject experts' articles
* partner relationships (eg powered by, API uses)
* job listings, events, coupons
* consistent publishing via blog, video, podcast, PDFs, Twitter, etc...

Check out your competitors linkable assets with: LinkInsight, Ahrefs.com, MajesticSEO.com, or Open
Site Explorer. Or use <http://search.twitter.com>.

## Link Opportunity Types

**What are the types of websites and pages likely to link to your assets?** Brainstorm opportunities
for each linkable asset in your list.

For example, if you have a thought leader CEO: guest posts, blogs in your space can do interviews,
comments on industry blogs, etc... Have 50x free dog grooming products to give out? Look for
pet-related charities with thank you pages for donors, bloggers who review products, dog info sites
featuring videos, youtubers who do reviews, bloggers who would like to run prizes, etc...

Common opportunities include:

* content placement (eg guest posts, op-ed pieces, article resyndication)
* profile listings (aggregation sites for jobs, events, products, company info, coupons, etc...)
* open conversations (blog comments, forums, QA sites, industry social sites)
* editorial mentions
* directory listings
* resource lists
* sponsored links

## Link Opportunity Analysis for Keyword Space

**What are the big head keywords for your space?** Whereas assets can target long tail keywords,
opportunities should use big head keywords. For example "dog blogs".

Gather a list of your big head keywords and search for:

* BHK blogs (or BHK blog)
* BHK forums (or BHK forum)
* BHK directories (or BHK directory)
* BHK community
* BHK association
* BHK intitle:interview
* BHK intitle:"q&a with"
* BHK intitle:"tips from" OR "advice from" OR "chat with"

Also gather curators, listings, guest opportunities:

* BHK add job*
* BHK submit software
* BHK submit pdf
* BHK add coupon
* BHK events
* BHK free tools
* BHK roundup
* BHK links
* BHK resource list
* BHK "guest post"
* BHK "guest article"
* BHK "write for us"
* BHK list
* list of BHK

Think about other keywords to use besides big head keywords. For example, think about products in
your space which can be reviewed: "dog grooming brush review". Search for that and see what sites
could possibly link to you.

Some advance search operators to use:

* intitle:
* inurl:
* site:
* ~ (synonyms)
* * (wild card)
* - (minus)
* intext:
* "" (exact phrase)

## Automating Link Prospecting with RSS

Once you have a list of keywords to search for link opportunities, you can automate searches so
you'll get a fresh list of search results over time. Use Google Alerts, Technorati Search Query RSS,
Google Blog Search, or Trackur.

## List Scrape Prospecting for Link Builders

Sometimes it's easier to use the works of curators. Search for "lists" that authors have already
assembled in your space for prospects. Search for:

* list of [institution]s
* list of U.S. [institution]s
* list of [a, b, c, etc.] websites
* list of [a, b, c, etc.] blogs
* top 10 [a, b, c, etc.] websites
* top 100 [a, b, c, etc.] blogs
* list of websites
* list of sites
* list of websites for
* list of sites

Every single search result will result in large lists of prospects.

1. Keywords appear in target URL

## Relationship Building

Some tactics for building relationships with others:

**Preciprocation** - promote other's good content before asking for links, your audience will trust
you as a curator and the content creator will notice you. You can do this by:

* linking to them in your posts, articles, tweets, shares, etc...
* asking for promotion after a while
* creating top 100 lists and include them in the list
* expert publisher group interviews
* promote your own customers
* solicit guest posts

The pillars of content distribution network:

* twitter/facebook
* company blog
* email newsletter
* forum/community platform
* niche social news site

## Analyzing Marketing Pains for Highly Linkable Content

Highly linkable assets include:

* how to's, guides, anything for DIYers (from blog posts, tweets, to PDFs)
* identify other linkable content in your market
* content created by thought leaders and subject experts
* tip based contents eg "Woodworking Tips" or ideas, techniques, ways to, advice, etc...

## Link Acquisition

**Always illustrate the value of your asset when asking for a link.**

Good example:

> I really enjoyed your piece on X. In fact, I mentioned it in our email newsletter, to my Twitter
> followers, and added it to this massive roundup of our industry's top resources (URL). Check it
> out and if you think it's worthy, please mention it to your readers! Also, I'd like to interview
> you for an upcoming articleâ€”are you open to answering some questions for my readers?

Some tips:

* demonstrate concern for their audience
* suggest mentions/sharing instead of requesting links
* have templates ready, but do some customization for each request
* send a custom 2nd email on ignores

respond. For example: if I could find a list of hospitals, what can I offer them?
