# Authority

By Nathan Barry, tips and techniques for self publishing.

# On Writing

Writing is valuable:

* teachers are remembered and publicized - Marco Polo wasn't the first explorer, just the first to
  teach about the new regions
* teaching establishes expertise
* teaching valuable skills will make you money

Only two factors determine if your book will be successful: does it teach a skill others use to make
money and do those people gather/communicate online?

To finish writing your book, be consistent by establishing a writing habit. Write ~1,000 words a
everyday.

To overcome writer's block, lower your standards. Write like you talk, then go back and refine later
on.

# Basic Marketing

Teach everything you know as a form of marketing. People will listen and you'll build an audience.

Other tactics include:

* build a landing page
* include an opt-in mailing list form on the landing page
* tell people about your new book (your audience, guest posts, etc...)
* demonstrate your expertise with epic blog posts (be valuable and show your style)
* capture leads with an opt-in form at the end of each blog post
* slowly drip content to your mailing list to build confidence
* launch to your mailing list

# Writing, Lots of Writing

How much writing goes into a book?

* 25,000-30,000 words for the book itself
* 7-10 guest posts averaging 1,000 words each
* 3 launch and update emails at 500 words each
* ~3 posts on your own site at 3,000+ words

At the low-end, that's 37,500 words. At 1,000 words non-edited, that's only 37 days (realistically
you'll want to double that amount for editing.)

Some tips for writing:

* write standing up
* have fun with research (eg read from other authors while vacationing by the pool)
* plan the final content (eg length, topics, outline)
* use editor(s)

# Pricing & Packaging

It's about value, so price high and use packages.

Nathan Barry used 3x packages for his recent book:

* The Book ($39)
* The Book + Videos ($79)
* The Complete Package ($169)

The last package includes video tutorials, Photoshop files, code samples, and additional training
materials. Price high and deliver on value.

The same material can be presented in different media for more value. Some examples:

* short video tips
* video interviews
* text interviews
* design resources
* sample code
* explanation screencasts
* video lessons
* photoshop files

Labels matter. Guides/courses are perceived to be worth more than books. Use these labels:

* courses
* guides
* kits
* lessons
* classes

# Prepping For Launch

Do not take the "write it and sales will come" approach.

Instead, build your audience and mailing list. Drip out content to keep in touch with your audience.
On launch day, send out a time-limited discount for being a fan.

To build your audience, you'll need to do guest posts for other related audiences.

Getting guest posts is a combination of relationships and content. Build your relationships with
other authors over time by subscribing to their content, leaving comments/suggestions, and sending
helpful messages. Eventually approach them with an offer to guest post.

Other strategies include: affiliates, sending preview copies out, gathering testimonials, giveaways.

# The Sales Page

Some tips/elements for the sales page:

* focus on the reader's pain
* why should someone care about your book?
* sample chapter
* table of contents
* social proof
* about the author
* listing of packages
* purchase option
* FAQ to overcome objections
* another purchase link

# E-Commerce

Nathan Barry advocates self publishing and selling on your own site. That way, you can communicate
directly with your customers.

Other alternatives include: Amazon and iBooks Store.

To sell yourself, consider using: Gumroad, PayPal, E-junkie, Space Box.

# The Launch and Beyond

Launch sequence:

1. Announce launch to your email list the day before
2. Final checks/tests to make sure sales page works
3. Morning of launch publish your sales page (use same URL as landing page)
4. Send a launch email to your mailing list
5. Contact your friends and ask them to share your sales page

Consider adding a drip sequence email to your sales page. Nathan's design email sequence:

1. Trimming down features
2. Learning to wireframe
3. Designing blank slate screens (soft sell)
4. Think about designing forms in a new way
5. Designing form fields and labels
6. Take your web app design to the next level (hard sell)
7. Adding style to your application design
8. Typography basics (soft sell)

# Closing Thoughts

**Start before you feel ready.**

You may not feel qualified now, but if you don't start you'll never become that expert. This one
habit will change everything.
