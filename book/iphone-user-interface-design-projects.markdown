## iPhone User Interface Design Projects

*I, [Michael Parker](http://omgitsmgp.com/), own this book and took these notes to further my own learning. If you enjoy these notes, please [purchase the book](http://www.amazon.com/iPhone-User-Interface-Design-Projects/dp/B005B1F51C)!*

### Chapter 1: App Cubby
* pg 5: Read the iPhone Human Interface Guidelines book, and conform to Apple's UI conventions.
* pg 8: Because the keyboard takes up so much space, have data entry focused on a single field or a small group of fields that fit above the keyboard.
* pg 11: Don't worry about minimizing taps; confusion about where to tap wastes more time than an extra tap.
* pg 17: Every touch of the screen should have some visual reaction, even if it doesn't actually accomplish anything.

### Chapter 2: Yet Another Google Reader
* pg 29: The navigation view paradigm is not adept at moving from sibling to sibling; an auxiliary menu can provide this functionality.
* pg 32: Apple's Application Definition Statement can help make right design decisions along the way, and has the format *[Your differentiator] [your solution] for [your audience]*.
* pg 34: The `apple-touch-icon.png` is a 57x57 image used when you make a home screen bookmark from Mobile Safari.

### Chapter 3: Brightkite for the iPhone
* pg 49: A more tab on the tab bar can expose features not worthy of the tab bar in a table view.
* pg 52: Make signing up for a service as minimal as possible; move any additional tasks to perform after sign-up somewhere else, like the settings tab.
* pg 55: A user can't tell the difference between a crash caused by a code defect and one that occurred at the hands of the memory watchdog.
* pg 56: The address book is a natural resource for discovering friends who use your service.

### Chapter 4: Outpost
* pg 63: Templating kits for OmniGraffle or Illustrator provide quick wire-framing abilities.
* pg 71: You can take screenshots of buttons from native applications and recreate them using purely vector shapes and layer effects
* pg 72: Textile is an alternative markup script to Markdown.

### Chapter 5: TanZen and Zentomino
* pg 84: Work with a real device as soon as possible; the iPhone screen is smaller than you expect.
* pg 87: Text can be explanatory, but it takes up screen space and needs to be internationalized.
* pg 96: It's easy to see a visual element under a cursor in the simulator, but not one under your finger on an actual device.
* pg 103: Give users what they need, not everything they want; otherwise your application will lack focus.
* pg 105: A lower price app sells more copies, which places you higher on rankings lists, and that visibility is important.

### Chapter 6: Flash of Genius: SAT Vocab
* pg 117: The Info button that comes with the iPhone API may be too small for many users to use; to fix this, put a big clear `UIButton` on top of it in Interface Builder.
* pg 120: Without a decent icon, no one will ever look at your application; without a good one, you don't get noticed.
* pg 122: Using `UIWebView` allows better control over typography with the risk of combining native and web elements in a messy fashion.
* pg 125: Using an `UIAlertView` to explain something is not optimal but gets the job done; just don't use more than a few.

### Chapter 7: Postage
* pg 131: Your application will be used on the go and for only a few moments at a time, so the interface must be streamlined.
* pg 134: Every application preference represents a point where the development team could not make a tough choice.
* pg 136: Do everything you can to delay or prevent having the user enter account credentials when using your application for the first time.
* pg 138: The navigation bar can be repurposed to guide the user through a series of steps in accomplishing some larger task.
* pg 147: Ensure that one partially obscured cell or item is visible in a list or table view to hint to the user that it can be scrolled.
* pg 150: If an icon can't entirely describe a concept and requires a label, consider dropping the icon to increase the label font size for clarity.
* pg 158: All lighting on the iPhone is from the top of the screen down; make your gradients, highlights, and drop shadows consistent with this.

### Chapter 8: Falling Balls and Gravity Pods
* pg 170: The accelerometer is a natural replacement for a directional pad on game controllers.
* pg 178: Sending messages to `nil` in Objective C is allowed and more efficient than explicitly checking if the receiver is `nil`.

### Chapter 9: Font Shuffle
* pg 184: A typeface comprises an alphabet of letters, and build a family with members such as Roman, Bold, Italic, etc.
* pg 187: The baseline is the only property of a digital typeface that is interpreted in a common way.
* pg 188: In metal type, the em was the height of the metal body from which the letter arises; it's comparable the bounding box from digital type design.
* pg 192: Some typography sources refer to sans-serif typefaces as Grotesque or Gothic, and serif types as Roman.
* pg 200: The Lucidia typeface is a superfamily that covers all design styles, so the capital heights, x-heights, and main stem weights are coordinated.

### Chapter 10: Snow Reports for the iPhone
* pg 217: Make the 1.0 release minimal; when you have feedback, decide features for the next version and release it, which assures users you're listening to them.
