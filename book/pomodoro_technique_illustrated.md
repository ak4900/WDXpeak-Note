# Pomodoro Technique Illustrated

By Staffan Noteberg, the Pomodoro Technique Illustrated is about how to implement the technique to
do easily do more in less time.

The Pomodoro Technique can be implemented by:

1. Creating a "todo today" list, estimate how many 25-minute increments per task, and setup a strict
   work timetable eg. 8:30AM-1:00PM and 2:00PM-5:30PM.
2. Work in 25-minute increments called "Pomodoro" with 3-5 minute breaks between each and 15-60
   minute breaks for every 4 Pomodoros. Start with an overview and end with a review.
3. Record data such as: # Pomodoros per task, # interruptions, etc... At the end of the day, review
   your records and use it to improve future estimations/habits.

## One Activity at a Time

You should focus on one activity at a time.

Why use the Pomodoro Technique?

1. It breaks down big tasks into manageable 25-minute chunks
2. It alleviates procrastination by establishing mini habits (each timebox is a habit loop)
3. It prioritizes importance over urgency with morning planning
4. It establishes a sustainable work rhythm
5. It "gets you into the flow" quickly via cues (starting a Pomodoro)
6. It records/reviews empirical data so you can learn from your mistakes
7. It improves estimation since you'll record how many Pomodoros it takes per task
8. It enforces single-tasking
9. It's easy to implement so there's less overhead
10. It separates strategic planning with tactical work

## Context

The Pomodoro Technique takes advantage of our strengths and weaknesses:

1. Focus - timeboxing forces you to focus on a single task per Pomodoro
2. Habits - each Pomodoro is a habit loop with cue: winding up the clock, routine: work, reward:
   finishing 1x atomic Pomodoro
3. Flow - the habit loop forces you to get into a "flow" with a pre-determined work/break schedule
4. Choice - the technique removes the "paradox of choice" problem of what to do next, since you have
   a pre-determined list from your morning planning

## Mechanics

A single Pomodoro consists of: choose the highest-priority activity on the To Do Today sheet, wind
up the clock to 25 minutes, and start focusing on that activity - and only that one.

A work day consists of:

1. Planning - commit to Todo Today Sheet with list of most important activities
2. Tracking - execute activities in 25-minute Pomodoros, track data at end of each Pomodoro
3. Recording - at end of day, record all data onto a separate sheet
4. Processing - turn raw data into useful information that you can use
5. Visualizing - get feedback from your processed information, how can you improve?

**Your Todo Today Sheet is a commitment.** Do not put tasks on the sheet that you don't think can be
finished today. Do not put tasks that you don't think can be finished in 25 minutes - break it up.
Include a timetable/schedule, so your estimates line up perfectly with the amount of time you'll
dedicate to working today. And remember it's just estimating, you'll get better at it overtime.

**Every Pomodoro is atomic.** If you can't finish a full Pomodoro, it doesn't count.

**Take a short break after every Pomodoro.** Your brain needs to rest to establish a good rhythm and
be prepared for the next Pomodoro.

**Take a set break after every 4x Pomodoros.** These are longer breaks that last 15-60 minutes.

## Interruptions

There are internal and external interruptions. Internal interruptions are when you get distracted
and start doing something else other than the task on hand. External interruptions are initiated by
someone else.

Here are some tips to deal with each. For internal interruptions:

* accept them, you'll get distracted and it's better to accept it
* record them, the author uses an apostrophe to mark internal interruptions
* continue and get back to work
* during your reviews, you'll see how bad your internal interruptions are interfering with your work
  and improve!
* visualize past interruptions and intensify your focus during Pomodoros
* if they persist, consider experimenting with shorter Pomodoro lengths

For external interruptions:

* record them
* disconnect from notifications (emails, IMs, text messages, etc...)
* for external requests, ask how long you can defer them when a request is received
* inform others of your Pomodoros (keep headphones on, have timer on desk, etc...)

## Estimate

**Be realistic with your estimates so that your todo today sheet is a real commitment.** This is
important because each task must be an attainable goal within 1 Pomodoro. All tasks together must be
an attainable end-of-day goal.

**Use historical data to improve your estimates.** You keep track of how many Pomodoros it takes per
each task so you can improve future estimates. Ideally, it should be 1x per task.

## Adapt

**Your todo today sheet can be adapted as the day goes on.** Record unplanned activities and which
planned tasks must be removed.

**Use data to determine the best amount of time for each Pomodoro and break.** It doesn't have to be
25 minutes and 5 minutes. Do what works best for you.

**Experiment with different cues.** Try a physical clock that you wind up. Experiment with software.
