# Mastering Product Launches

How to launch products course by Nathan Barry available at <http://buildingprofitableaudiences.com>.

# Foundations

It doesn't matter if you have a huge email list, you need to plan out your launch to avoid failure.
This course will teach you systems to put into place.  Some foundations:

* teaching is the best form of marketing
* teaching establishes credibility and builds your audience
* emulate chefs: all the chefs you've heard of shared their recipes
* use email to connect with your audience
* email converts better than social network (~15x)
* emails act like a todo in an inbox
* emails are surrounded by important content in the inbox
* emails have much higher engagement and provide a personal connection
* don't use heavily branded/designed templates, strip it down to basic almost plain-text emails so
  it's more personal

# Building an Email List

Create an effective landing page:

* what is it -- describe your product, preferably with a large centered graphic
* have a bold header that catches attention and draws visitors in, talk about the pain you're fixing
* follow it up with paragraphs on benefits and how to solve the problem
* email opt-in form which is the call to action for this landing page
* the email opt-in is the logical conclusion
* add "We won't spam, promise."
* remove anything that distracts from your call to action (other links, buttons, etc...)

Getting traffic:

* think of 10x actual people who would be a good fit for your product
* if you can't think of 10x, re-think your product
* where do these people hang out online, what sites do they read, do those sites accept guest posts?
* ask friends to promote it with individual emails
* find subreddits where your audience hangs out, participate on community, share your landing page
* other communities: Hacker News, Product Hunt, Beta List, iOS Dev Weekly, Ruby Weekly, Founder Weekly

Conversion rates:

* conversion rates are correlated more with your traffic than your page itself
* for higher conversion rates, use highly targeted traffic

Consider buying ads:

* it's a great way to collect emails
* keep track of average cost per subscriber and cost per sale
* Nathan's ROI on Twitter ads were 11x

# Pricing and Pre-orders

Price based on value:

* higher priced products require less conversions and increases revenue
* higher prices are essential if you have a small audience
* teach a skill that makes money, to people who have money, so you can price on value
* deliver a ton of value and charge accordingly
* charge more if your product caters to businesses (who have employee costs)

Double revenue with multiple packages:

* use tiered pricing to gain more revenue
* charge more for products that deliver more value
* Nathan saw 60% of his revenue come from his top tier
* multiple packages utilizers price anchoring: how much is a book worth vs video course?
* your customers have different budgets

What to put in each package:

* base package tells them what to do
* higher packages does as much as it for customers as possible
* people who value time over money can purchase higher packages
* consider adding consulting time to highest tier
* example for fiction: base book, higher package includes behind-the-scenes and short stories

On pre-orders:

* offer a discount and collect money upfront
* the people who pre-order are biggest fans of products, reward them with a discount
* but don't discount too much that it hurts your revenue
* do a pre-launch for the pre-orders by building up anticipation and adding urgency

# Working With Others

On guest posts:

* borrow other audiences as early as possible
* from your ideal customer, find out where they hang out online -- do these sites accept guest posts?
* if a site is multi-author, they are much more likely to accept guest posts
* people with guest posts get pitched many times so you have to be compelling
* write a relevant guest post, include entire article, and link to it in am email
* schedule your posts to work around your launch date but remember big sites have editorial calendars

# Launch Tactics to Consider

On webinars:

* webinars are useful for its personal connection and to teach as marketing
* add urgency in your sales by only selling during webinar
* use Google Hangouts or Go To Webinar (Nathan recommends Hangouts)

Getting customers to sell for you:

* consider adding referrals
* Coin's system was refer 4 and get it for free, this spread virally
* Wealthfront offers a referral system where they'll manage more for free if you refer friends

# Multiple Launches

Why launches are important for sales:

* urgency, such as limited discounted prices, drives sales
* consider closing off sales after a period of time so you can launch again later on
* consider re-launching products once a year

How to launch multiple times:

* drive people to an email list
* launch first time, then replace landing page with email opt-in again
* have auto-responder drip emails to stay in touch with leads
* every quarter or once a year, launch again
* Micropreneur Academy got 3x conversion rates by closing off signups and rolling launches

Creating systems to automate launches:

* think about Apple: multiple products and a refresh about once a year
* commit to a schedule so you don't launch too often but make sure each product gets refreshed
  continually
* John Lee Dumas launches the same product every week, systematizing via Facebook Ads -> Webinars ->

# After the Launch

How to drive ongoing sales:

* typically visitors will forget about your product after visiting your landing page
* use email opt-in forms with lead magnets and email courses
* teach topics related to your product, this reminds visitors about your product
* in 3rd/4th email have a soft sell that points them back, maybe a hard sale in a later email
* continue writing tutorials, guest posting, and teaching

How to up-sell and cross-sell:

* if you sold in multiple packages, you can up-sell (but don't expect great conversion rates)
* sell another product that targets the same audience
* stick to one audience so you don't have to build another audience

Continue growing your audience:

* look at paid ads to drive new visitors/subscribers
* go back to doing guest posts
* have a free email course or sample chapter, drive people at end of guest post to that
* after you write a guest post, promote it -- the better it does the better chance that you'll be
  asked to return

# Urgency

Why does urgency matter?

* visitors think they'll come back later to make a purchase but they never come back
* urgency prompts the visitor to purchase now
* three ways to do it: sales, bonus, or limited launch

Run a sale:

* example: 20% off for first 24 hours
* rewards your early customers and people on email list
* don't run too big of a discount, you'll be missing out on too much revenue
* too small discount won't motivate sales and is kind of insulting

Provide a bonus:

* example: buy within first 72 hours to get course + one-time webinar
* consider adding more content for early customers

Limit sales:

* example: only sell the product during a limited window, such as during a webinar
* another example: limit number of seats sold
* this works great for ConvertKit and Podcasters Paradise

# Building Anticipation

Silence can kill your launch:

* if you don't stay in touch and then send an email, that email will be marked as spam
* be in contact about every 2-3 weeks if the launch is far away out
* be in contact every 1-2 weeks if the launch is coming up
* provide updates about product or teach valuable content
* consider providing behind-the-scenes updates

Use epic blog posts to grow your list:

* write great blog posts or tutorials to grow your list
* if you were writing a book, a blog post would be good enough to be in that book
* don't write "5 ways to do X", write epic posts that are valuable
* re-use that content for your email list

# The Launch Sequence

How to build anticipation:

* last 3-4 weeks from launch, let people know that the product is coming for sale
* ask subscribers questions "PS is there anything you'd like to know about this product?"
* reply to those emails, collect the questions, and form an FAQ
* provide plenty of information about the product before offering the sale

What to do one week before launch:

* put sales page live
* swap it out with opt-in landing page
* test purchasing flow
* send email to list that your product is live
* check on guest posts that were supposed to go live today
* take a break

Use reminders to drive sales:

* on launch day or right before, send an email to your subscribers
* 24-48 hours before the sales end, send another reminder email
* make sure there's enough time to deal with time zone differences
