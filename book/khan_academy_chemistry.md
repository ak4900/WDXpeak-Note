Salman Khan's Chemistry videos. For the full videos, see <http://www.khanacademy.org>.

# Introduction to the Atom

**Atom** is the Greek word for uncuttable. It's actually made up of neutrons, protons, electrons.
The nucleus is made up of neutrons/protons and the electrons "orbit" around the nucleus.

**Orbital** is the probability function where you're likely to find an electron.

An **electron** has negative charge. A **proton** has positive charge. A neutron has a neutral
charge. The further away an electron is from the nucleus, the more potential energy the atom has
because opposite charges attract.

The number of protons in an element will identify it and is known as the **Atomic Number**.

Each proton/neutron is 1 **Atomic Mass Unit** =~ 1.67x10^27kg. An element's AM is the number of
protons + number of neutrons.

The **Atomic Weight** is included in the periodic tables. Carbon has an atomic weight of 12.0107. If
you average all Carbon elements, the average number of neutrons is 6.0107. Carbons usually have 12
neutrons, but an **isotope** exists with Carbon-14 (14 neutrons). An isotope is just an element with
a different version with a different number of neutrons.

The nucleus is about 1/10,000 of the total volume of an atom. If you look at your hand, 99.999% of
it is just vacuum.

# Orbitals

The electron can be thought of as a sphere around the nucleus. We only know the probability of the
location of an electron. It's denser as you get to the center.

The **Bohr** model uses an orbit, where the electron has a path around the nucleus. It's similar to
the planet orbiting around the sun. The further away an electron is from the nucleus, the more
energy there is.

Orbits further away are known as being "higher". An electron can stay in a higher orbit if the lower
orbit is already occupied - due to repelling negative charges.

Elements can have different orbital shapes depending on the number of electrons they have and which
**period** or row they're in the periodic table. See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital>.

For example: Hydrogen has 1 proton. Assuming it's neutral, it has 1 electron. It'll go into the
first energy shell (1s energy shell). The **electron configuration** is 1s^1 which is just a sphere
that's dense in the middle.

Helium's electron configuration is 1s^2. So within the first energy shell, there's two electrons.
Lithium's is 1s^2*2s^1. That's two electrons in the first shell and one electron in the second
shell.

# More on Orbitals and Electron Configuration

The further away an electron is from the nucleus, the higher its energy state. Electrons want to
occupy the lower orbits/energy states first. You can think of it like stacking blocks (start low).
Electrons cannot be crammed into the same orbital because they'll start repelling each other.

We started with 1s and 2s. Next are the P orbitals: Pz, Px, Py. They're dumbbell shaped orbitals
that are horizontal, vertical, and along the z-axis. They fill in the order of z-axis, x-axis,
y-axis.

Carbon's electron configuration are: `1s^2*2s^2*2p^2`

The two left columns of elements will fill the S orbitals. The 6 right columns will fill the P
orbitals (except Helium, which should be moved to the S orbital columns). The middle 10 columns
belong in the D orbitals. The island 14 columns (which are actually placed in between the D orbital
columns) will occupy the F orbitals.

You can always double-check your configuration by counting the number of electrons. For the Carbon
above, that's 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

# Electron Configurations

The D shells are different. The number shell should actually be the period minus one. So Mn should
occupy 3d^6 at its highest orbital even though it's in the 4th period. The ending configuration of
Mn is: `4s^2*3d^6`

Although the 3d shell is higher energy than 4s, 4s is actually the outer shell. The electrons in the
outer shell are the **Valence Electrons** and they're often used in Chemistry.

The ending configuration of La is: `6s^2*4f^1`. The F shell uses the period of an element minus two.
So the La periods is in the 6th period, but its F shell electrons are the 4th F shell.

# Electron Configurations 2

The electron configuration for Nickel is:

    1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^8

Although 3d^8 has higher energy, 4s^2 electrons are the furthest away and will be used in most
Chemical reactions. They're Valence electrons.

Sal shows us a great trick to write out electron configurations:

      | s | p | d | f
    1   o 
    2   o   o
    3   o   o   o
    4   o   o   o   o

Use the chart above to fill out configurations in a diagonal matter. Start with 1s, then 2s, then 2p
3s, then 3p 4s, and go on.

Or you can just use the periodic table and work backwards. The periodic table may be less error
prone.

# Valence Electrons

There's a shorthand for writing out electron configuration, for Lithium it's:

    [He] 2s^1

That is, it's the same as Helium's electron configuration with an extra electron in the 2s shell.
For Iron it's:

    [Ar] 4s^2 3d^6

It takes more energy to cram an electron in 3d than 4s because it's crowded, even though the
electrons in 4s are further away.

On the periodic table, the **groups** are the columns. Everything in groups 3 to 12 will have 2
electrons in its outer-most shell. This is because the new electrons occupy a lower d-shell.
Everything in group 2 will have 2 electrons in its outer-most shell also. Listing out electrons in
the outer-most shell for each group:

* Group #1: 1
* Group #2: 2
* Group #3 to #12: 2
* Group #13: 3
* Group #14: 4
* Group #15: 5
* Group #16: 6
* Group #17: 7
* Group #18: 8 (except Helium)

For Selenium:

    [Ar] 4s^2 3d^10 4p^4

In the fourth shell, there are 2 electrons in the S orbital and 4 electrons in the P orbital. That
totals for 6 electrons in the outer-most shell - which is correct for group #16.

The **valence electrons** or outer-most electrons are all we care about in reactions. There's a
shorthand notation which only takes outer electrons into account:

     H. for one electron (middle-align the dot!)
     F: for two valence electrons
    :C: for four valence electrons

All atoms want to have **8 electrons** in their outer-most shell because it's the most stable state.

Potassium (K) has 1 valence electron. Potassium (Cl) has 7 valence electrons. If you put K in the
presence of Cl, K's electron will jump to Cl.

Alkali metals really want to get rid of their electrons, especially when close to Halogen elements.
Except for Hydrogen, cause its only got one!

# Groups of the Periodic Table

* Group #1 are the Alkali Metals (except Hydrogen)
* Group #2 are the Alkali Earth Metals and want to give away 2 electrons
* Groups #3-12 are the Transition Metals
* Groups #13-16 have a mix of Metals and other
* Group #17 are Halogens
* Group #18 are the Noble Gases

Alkali Metals are seldom found in their elemental state. They're highly reactive and usually combine
with other elements.

When electrons are added to Transition Metals, they just backfill their previous D orbitals. They
just want to lose their 2 outer electrons. Metals are very giving with their electrons.

Metals are great conductors because they have surplus electrons which can move around easily.

As we get to group #13 (with 3 outer electrons), atoms are less likely to want to get rid of their
electrons. Electrons closer to the nucleus are harder to give up, while electrons further away are
easier. That's why metals trend to the bottom elements of the periodic table.

Hydrogen used to be used as a gas, but it was very combustible because it always reacted with other
elements. Now, Helium is used because it has its outer shell full and doesn't like to react with
other elements.

# Periodic Table Trends: Ionization Energy

**Ionization Energy** is the energy required to remove an electron from the neutral version of the
atom.

An **ion** is an atom with a different number of protons and electrons. They have charges.

    H -> H^+1 + e^-1

`H^+1` is a **cation**, an ion with a positive charge. An **anion** is an ion with a negative
charge.

Group #1 (Alkali Metals) require very little energy to remove an electron. It requires very little
energy to ionize them.

Electrons which are further away, it gets easier to take them away. So elements near the bottom of
the periodic table require lower ionization energy then the top elements.

The energy trend for the table is:

    Low -> High
            |
           Low

# Other Periodic Table Trends

**2nd Ionization Energy** is the energy required to remove the 2nd electron from the neutral version
of an atom.

A **covalent bond** occurs when atoms share electrons. If you have an oxygen atom and two hydrogen
atoms, they'll share electrons. Hydrogens will fill its 1s shell and oxygen will its 2p shell. Both
will be in a more stable state.

When drawing it out, a line usually means a covalent bond:

      ..       ..
    H:O:H    H-O-H
      ..       ..

**Electronegativity** is the measure of how likely an atom will hog an electron in covalent bonds.
Halogen Gases react often and have high electronegativity. Alkali Metals have low electronegativity
because they want to get rid of their electrons. It's the same trend direction as ionization energy.

**Metallic Nature** is the willingness to give away electrons. It's sort of the opposite of
electronegativity. The bottom left elements have a high metallic nature and the top right elements
have a low one.

**Atomic Radius** is the length between the nucleus and outer shell. As you go down the periodic
table, the atomic radius is increasing. Moving right, size decreases due to an increase in
protons/coloumb force (without adding a new shell).

# Ionic, Covalent, and Metallic Bonds

Atoms stick together and form **molecules**.

         .          ..
    Na. :Cl: -> Na :Cl: (Na^+1 + Cl^-1)
         ..         ..

Sodium gives away its electron and chlorine gets one. They both become ionized and are attracted to
each other. They form an **ionic bond**.

     .. ..    ..   ..
    :O  O: ->  O = O
     .. ..    ..   ..

These oxygen atoms are sharing two electrons each and form a **covalent bond**. This usually occurs
in atoms which are similar with each another.

A **polar covalent bond** is a specific type of covalent bond where one atom has higher
electronegativity and the other. Each atom gets a partial charge.

If you put together a lot of iron, they share their electrons. They all get a positive charge and
create an excess of electrons. The atoms become attracted to the pool of electrons around them. This
is a **metallic bond**.

# Molecular and Empirical Formulas

Empirical means achieved through experience or experimentation.

**Empirical Formula** tells you what people observe without precise molecular measurements.

The **Molecular Formula** tells us the precise molecular measurements, not just ratios. Examples:

               Molecular      Empirical
    Benzene:   C(6)H(6)       CH
    Water:     H(2)O          H(2)O
    Sulfur:    S(8)           S
    Glucose:   C(6)H(12)O(6)  CH(2)O

The **Structural Formula** tells us the precise molecular measurements, shows each bond, and is a
graph of the overall structure.

Carbon is 12 atomic mass units. Hydrogen's average atomic mass unit is 1 - it tends to not have a
neutron. The **molecular mass** of Benzene is:

    C(6)H(6) = (6*12) + (6*1) = 78 AMU

Benzene is 92.3% Carbon by mass (6*12)/78.

# The Mole and Avogadro's Number

A **Mole** in Chemistry is just a number: 6.02x10^23. This is also called **Avogadro's Number**.

Officially, the mole is the amount of substance of a system that contains as many atoms as 12 grams
of carbon-12.

    6.02x10^23 Carbon-12 Atoms is 12 grams of Carbon
    Carbon-12 has an AMU of 12
    1 gram = 1 mole of AMUs

So 1 mole of Al-27 is 27 grams, since the AMU of aluminum is 26.98.

# Formula and Mass Composition

We can get the mass composition of a molecule and get the empirical formula:

    H(2)O => (2*1 AMU) + (1 * 16 AMU) => 2/18 Hydrogen, 16/18 Oxygen

Let's go the other way around. We have a bag of stuff that's 75% mercury and 25% chlorine. What's
the empirical formula?

1. Assume 100g of of molecules
2. That means 75g of Hg and 25g of Cl
3. 1 mole of Hg = ~200 AMU = 200g, 1 mole of Cl = ~35 AMU = 35g
4. Convert from grams to moles: .375 moles of Hg, .714 moles of Cl
5. 2 moles of Cl per 1 mole of Hg
6. HgCl(2)

# Balancing Chemical Equations

Let's start with an unbalanced equation:

    _Al + _O(2) -> _Al(2)O(3)

Right now, two molecules of aluminum came out of one. Three molecules from oxygen came from two.
Fill in the blanks to balance:

    2Al + 1.5O(2) -> Al(2)O(3)

But you can't have partial molecules, they need to be shown in whole amounts of moles:

    4Al + 3O(2) -> 2Al(2)O(3)

Let's react ethylene with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water:

    _C(2)H(4) + _O(2) -> _CO(2) + _H(2)O

The general rule is to work with the more complicated molecules first. It's easier to deal with
single atom molecules later on.

Start with the carbons. There are two on the left, one on the right. Let's balance that:

    C(2)H(4) + _O(2) -> 2CO(2) + _H(2)O

Now let's balance the hydrogens. There's 4 on the left side and 2 on the right side.

    C(2)H(4) + _O(2) -> 2CO(2) + 2H(2)O

Finally, let's balance the oxygen. There's 2 on the left, 6 on the right.

    C(2)H(4) + 3O(2) -> 2CO(2) + 2H(2)O

If you ever end up with a fraction of a molecule, just multiply by a number on both sides of the
equation to balance everything out:

    C(2)H(6) + 3.5O(2) -> 2CO(2) + 3H(2)O
    2C(2)H(6) + 7O(2) -> 4CO(2) + 6H(2)O

This one may look complicated, but the key to solving it is noticing that the molecule SO(4) stays
intact. Just treat that as its own atom:

    _Fe(3)O(3) + _H(2)SO(4) -> _Fe(2)(SO(4))(3) + _H(2)O

Balanced is:

    Fe(2)O(3) + 3H(2)SO(4) -> Fe(2)(SO(4))(3) + 3H(2)O

# Stoichiometry

**Stoichiometry** is the calculation of measurable relationships of the reactants and products in a
balanced chemical equation. It can be used to calculate the percentage yield from given reactants.

Stoichiometry related questions are similar to:

* If I give you X grams of this, how many grams of that would you get?
* How many grams of this is required to get X grams of that?

You can use the ratios in balanced chemical equation to answer these questions.

    Fe(2)O(3) + 2Al -> Al(2)O(3) + 2Fe

Given 85g of Fe(2)O(3), how many grams of aluminum is required for a reaction?

1. The atomic mass of Fe(2)O(3) is `56*2 + 16*3 = 160`
2. Fe(2)O(3) is 160g per mole
3. 85g of iron oxide is (85/160) or .53 moles
4. We need twice as many aluminimum or 1.06 moles of Al
5. Al is 27AMU or 27g per mole
6. We need (1.06*27g) or 28.62g of Al

If we had more than 28.62g of Al, there would be leftover aluminum. If that were the case, the iron
oxide would be the **limiting reagent** of the reaction - since there was enough aluminium but not
enough iron oxide.

# Stoichiometry: Limiting Reagent

    4NH(3) + 5O(2) -> 4NO + 6H(2)O

Given 34g of NH(3) and 32g of O(2), how much NO and H(2)O are produced? What's the limiting reagent?

1. NH(3) is 17amu or 17g per mole
2. We have 2 moles of NH(3)
3. O(2) is 32amu or 32g per mole
4. We have 1 mole of O(2)

Oxygen is the limiting reagent in this reaction. We have more than enough ammonia, but not enough
oxygen. We can use up all of the oxygen but only .8 moles of ammonia (using the 4:5 ratio):

    .8NH(3) + O(2) -> .8NO + 1.2H(2)O  // divide everything by 5

With 1.2 moles of NH(3) leftover:

    .8NH(3) + O(2) -> .8NO + 1.2H(2)O + 1.2NH(3)

# Ideal Gas Equation: PV=nRT

Pressure is just force per area:

    P = F/A

Picture a balloon with many particles inside. The faster they accelerate, the more pressure there is
on the surface area. This can be measured by temperature, which tells us the avg energy/particle.
Also, more particles means more pressure.

    P = R(nT) // where R = constant, n = # particles, T = temperature

The surface area is important too though, which is determined by volume. Volume is inversely
porportional to the pressure. More volume means more surface area.

    PV = R(nT) // where V = volume

This is usually written as:

    PV=nRT

And is known as the **Ideal Gas Equation**.

# Ideal Gas Equation Example 1

Given these properties:

1. 2 liter balloon containing H(2)
2. 30 degrees celsius (30 + 273 = 303 degrees kelvin)
3. 2 atmospheric pressure

How many moles of H(2) do we have?

Substituing for PV=nRT:

    2atm * 2L = n * R * 303K

Determine which constant of R to use with the units in your equation:

1. R = 8.3145 `(m^3 * Pa)/(mol * K)`
2. R = 8.3145 `(L * KPa)/(mol * K)`
3. R = .082 `(L * atm)/(mol * K)`

    2atm * 2L = n * (0.82 L*atm/mol*K) * 303K
    n = .16 moles of H(2) or .32g of Hydrogen

# Ideal Gas Equation 2

Given the properties of a balloon:

1. P = 3atm
2. V = 9 liters

If we change the volume of the balloon to 3 liters without changing the number of molecules or the
temperature, what's the new pressure?

    P(1)V(1) = nRT
    P(2)V(2) = nRT
    P(1)V(1) = P(2)V(2)
    3atm * 9L = P(2) * 3L
    P(2) = 9atm

PV/T will always be a constant, assuming the number of molecules in the system never changes. This
is a handy equation because it's what occurs often - at least in exams.

    P(1)V(1)     P(2)V(2)
    --------  =  -------
      T(1)         T(2)

**Standard temperature and pressure or STP** is a common phrase. The world hasn't really
standardized it, but most classes have set it to 0 degrees celsius and 1 atm.

Using PV=nRT, one mole of ideal gas will always fill up 22.4L of volume at STP. You can use this
ratio to your advantage when working with STP:

# Partial Pressure

So far, we've only dealt with a single type of molecule filling up a balloon. What about multiple
types of particles? **Partial pressure** is the percentage of pressure each type of molecule gives.

Given the properties of a balloon:

1. 2.1kg of gas
2. Gas is made up of 30.48% O(2), 2.86% H(2), 66.67% N(2)
3. O degrees celsius
4. 4m^3 volume

First, figure out the number of moles for each element:

1. 30.48% of 2.1kg = 640.08g, O(2) is 32g/mole, we have 20 moles of O(2)
2. 2.86% of 2.1kg = 60.06g, H(2) is 2g/mole, we have 30 moles of H(2)
3. 66.67% of 2.1kg = 1.4kg, N(2) is 28g/mole, we have 50 moles of N(2)

There's a total of 100 moles of particles. We can apply this to find the total pressure of the
balloon:

    P * 4(m^3) = 100mol * 8.3145(m^3Pa/molK) * 273K
    P = 25 * 8.3145 * 273 Pa
    P = 56.746 kPa or 0.56 atm  (total presure!)

The partial pressure can be determined using the ratios of the number of particles (NOT the mass!).

1. Pressure of O(2) = 20% of 0.56 atm = 0.112 atm
2. Pressure of H(2) = 30% of 0.56 atm = 0.168 atm
3. Pressure of N(2) = 50% of 0.56 atm = 0.28 atm

# States of Matter

There are three states of matter on Earth:

1. Solid
2. Liquid
3. Gas

The list is ordered from cold to hot. When molecules are cold, it's solid. As it gets hotter it
turns to liquid. At a high temperature it becomes a gas.

When the average kinetic energy of matter is very low (temperature), the molecules will be attracted
to each other and is solid. The positive charge in oxygen is attracted to the negative charge of
hydrogen in multiple H(2)O molecules. This forms ice.

When you add kinetic energy, the atoms start to vibrate and breaks the hydrogen bonds that H(2)O
have with each other. They're still attracted to each other, but the bonds will start breaking. The
molecules will shift past each other and become liquid water.

Adding more kinetic energy, the molecules won't even be able to be attracted to each other. They'll
break apart and won't touch, creating gas.

**Enthalpy** is heat content. The change in enthalpy is the change in heat. In graphs, heat is
usually denoted by the letter `q`. Enthalpy, heat, kinetic energy are all forms of energy measured
in joules.

As you add heat, molecules will vibrate more and the temperature will increase. Remember,
temperature is just the measure of average kinetic energy.

Below 0 degrees celsius, H(2)O is solid ice. After 0 degrees celsius, adding heat will interestingly
have the same temperature of 0 degrees for a while. H(2)O will still be ice, until you get to the
point above 0 degrees.

At 100 degrees celsius, H(2)O will boil into vapor. Adding heat will once again not increase the
temperature for a bit. After passing a limit, the temperature will begin increasing again.

See this horrible ascii diagram:

         |         /
         |     ___/   <-- 100 degrees
    temp |    /
         | __/        <-- 0 degrees
         |/
         +---------------
              q (energy)

In those flat areas at 0/100 degrees, the kinetic energy was being used to break the bonds in the
molecules. It increases their potential energy, because they want to fall towards each other. The
heat goes into potential energy instead of the temperature.

**Fusion** is the phase between solid/liquid. **Vaporization** is the phase between liquid/gas.

# States of Matter Follow-Up

There's also a 4th state of matter in the universe: **Plasma**. This occurs when gas is ionized and
is correlated with a very high temperature.

When a gas gets to a high temperature, the electrons bump off and the molecules become ionized -
similar to solid metals. There's almost a sea of electrons in the matter.

The best example of plasma on Earth is lightning. Another example in the universe are stars.

# Specific Heat, Heat of Fusion and Vaporization

**Specific heat** is the amount of heat used to change the states of matter or temperature for a
molecule. Each molecule has its own distinct specific heat.

For H(2)O, the heat of fusion is 333.55 J/g. The heat of vaporization is 2757 J/g. This is the
energy applied during those flat areas of state change.

So 1g of liquid water would turn to 1g of liquid vapor with 2757 joules.

What about the amount of energy it takes to increase the temperature? The specific heats for H(2)O
are:

1. Solid: 2.05 J/g*K
2. Liquid: 4.178 J/g*K
3. Gas: 1.89 J/g*K

How much energy is required to change 200g, -10 degrees celsius of ice to 110 degrees celsius of
vapor?

    -10 deg ice -> 0 deg ice = 2.05 J/g*K * 200g * 10K = 4100 joules
    0 deg ice -> 0 deg water = 333.55 J/g * 200g = 67,110 joules
    0 deg water -> 100 deg water = 4.178 J/g*K * 200g * 100K = 83,560 joules
    100 deg water -> 100 deg vapor = 333.55 J/g * 200g = 451,700 joules
    100 deg vapor -> 110 deg vapor = 1.89 J/g*K * 200g * 10K = 3,780 joules
    Total is 609 kJ

# Chilling Water Problem

Given the following:

1. 500g of liquid water @ 60 deg C
2. -10 deg C of ice

How much of the -10 deg C ice is needed to bring the liquid water down to 0 deg celsius?

When putting ice into water, the ice will absorb the heat from the water. The ice has to absorb the
energy, but if we don't have enough ice than it will melt.

The amount of energy required to bring 60C water to 0C is:

    H(out) = 4.178J/g*K * 500g * 60K = 125,340J

The amount of energy required to go from -10C to 0C is:

    H(absorbed) = 2.05J/g*K * X * 10K = 20.5 * X joules

`H(absorbed)` is just the heat required to go from ice to water times mass.

    H(absorbed) = 333.55 J/g * X
    H(total-absorbed) = 333.55 J/g * X + 20.5 * X

The amount of energy the ice absorbs must equal the energy leaving the water:

    125340 = 333.55x + 20.5x
    x = 354g of ice is required

# Phase Diagrams

A **phase diagram** is a graph that will tell you if you're dealing with a solid, liquid or gas. The
y-axis is pressure, the x-axis is temperature, and the different areas represent each state.

Horrible ascii diagram:

                  temperature

At 1atm and 100C, we're at the boundary of solid/liquid. But if we increase the pressure, the
temperature required is lower. It's also easier to boil water at a lower pressure. It's easier to
boil at the top of Mt Everest than at the bottom of Death Valley.

The more pressure you have, the harder it is for molecules to disconnect their bonds. Less pressure
makes it easier (less energy) to go from solid -> liquid or solid -> gas.

**Sublimation** is going from solid to gas. **Deposition** is the reverse. The equilibrium point at
which all states meet (due to pressure/temperature) is the **triple point**.

The **critical point** occurs at very high temperature/pressure. At that point, it becomes a
super-critical fluid. For water, it's a solvent that's used for cleaning.

# Van Der Waals Forces

Neon has 8 electrons in its outer shell. It's in a stable state by itself, so it shouldn't want to
be bonded with each other. But if it's cold enough, there is a liquid state. That means there's some
force bonding them together.

Electrons are dispersed, they not be evenly distributed all around. One side might have a negative
charge and the other might have a positive charge - for a very short amount of time.

These imbalanced neons may be attracted to each other. This is a very weak force called the **London
dispersion** force. It's the weakest of the **Van Der Waals forces** - the class of all
inter-molecular forces that are not covalent/ionic bonds.

Because of its stable state and the only attractive force it has with each other is weak, it's
likely to be in a gas state (and an ideal gas with little interference).

ClH have an ionic bond. The Cl side has a negative charge, the H side has a positive charge. So when
another ClH molecule is present, they have an attraction. This is called **Dipole Attraction**.

    (-) Cl-H (+) (-) Cl-H (+)

The **Hydrogen Bond** is a special case of Dipole Attraction. It's the interaction of a hydrogen
atom with an electronegative atom.

# Covalent Networks, Metallic, and Ionic Crystals

**Covalent Network** is the strongest molecular structure that forms a crystal. A crystal is just a
regular structure with a pattern (vs amorphous).

An example of a covalent network are the bonds formed by multiple carbons. The carbons each share
electrons with one another.

The next strongest bonds are **ionic crystals** and **metallic crystals**. An ionic crystal is NaCl:

    Na^+ Cl^-

One atom is negative, the other is positive and they're attracted to each other. It's brittle, if
you hit a big block of salt it'll break apart. When you're breaking something at a macro level,
you're just breaking the atomic bonds.

When placed in water, ionic crystals form **ionic dipole** or **ionic polar** bonds. The positive Na
gets attracted to the negative side of H(2)O and Cl gets attracted to the positive side. It starts
to dissolve.

An example of metallic crystals are grouped Fe atoms. They roam free, which form this sea of
electrons (makes it a very good conductor). Since their electrons roam, the Fe atoms become slightly
positive and become attracted to the sea of electrons. It's not as brittle as ionic crystals, but
it's a little softer due to the sea of electrons.

# Vapor Pressure, Volatility, and Evaporation

Atoms with enough kinetic energy may escape the bonds. These are usually the surface atoms, as they
don't bump into other ones. When molecules get enough kinetic energy, it'll escape - normally called
**evaporation**.

Some of the vapor that escapes will lose its kinetic energy. When that happens, the atoms fall back
into the structure. This is normally called **condensation**.

In a closed system, eventually the rate of evaporation and condensation reach an equilibrium. This
means the amount of gas/liquid doesn't change. The pressure created by the gas in this closed system
is called **Vapor Pressure**.

Something that wants to evaporate, more of its molecules will have to enter the vapor state to reach
equilibrium. It's said to have high vapor pressure. These substances are more **volatile**.

When the vapor pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure, it's the boiling point of the
substance. For example, at 100C H(2)O boils. The vapor pressure of H(2)O at 100C is 1atm.

If you lower the atmospheric pressure by going high up on a mountain, you can boil water at a much
lower temperature.

# Suspensions, Colloids and Solutions

**Homogenous mixtures** are uniform and common throughout. The most common example is homogenous
milk. Normally, milk's fat floats to the top and the bottom is all liquid. Homegenous milk has fat
evenly distributed.

If you have particles within a mixture thats greater than 500 nanometers, you're dealing with
**Suspension**. Particles usually float to the top or sink to the bottom of a mixture - shake it and
they are suspended for a bit. Think chocolate milk (sugar/chocolate on bottom).

If particles are between 2 to 500 nanometers, you're dealing with a **Colloid**. It's a homogenous
mixture where the particles are small enough that they stay suspended. The intermolecular forces
outweigh the particle's want to leave the solution. Think Jello, fog, or smoke.

If it's less than 2 nanometers, it's a **Solution**. 99% of mixtures we talk about in Chemistry are
solutions. The **solute** is the thing dissolved and the **solvent** is the thing surrounding.

    NaCl(aq) // means it's in water

**Mole Fraction** is the number of moles solute divided by total moles in the solution:

                              # of moles solute
    Mole Fraction =  -----------------------------------
                     # of moles solute + # moles solvent
                   
**Molarity** is the moles of solute divided by liters of solution:

               # of moles solute
    Molarity = ------------------
               liters of solution

Molarity changes when the pressure/temperature change, since volume is dependent on pressure and
temperature. A better measurement is **Molality**:

               # of moles solute
    Molality = ------------------
                 kgs of solvent

The mass of the solvent stays constant unlike the volume.

# Solubility

In Chemistry, a **Salt** is a neutral compound made of ions. NaCl is a salt (both chemistry and
seasoning).

When placed into water, the positive canion of Na is attracted to the negative oxygen. The negative
anion of Cl is attracted to the positive hydrogen.

The warmer the water, the better NaCl can fit in it. More kinetic energy means H(2)O molecules are
moving more, giving room for NaCl.

The general rule is as temperature goes up, **solubility** goes up for solids.

After salt is mixed in, you'll have a very good conductor because of the mixed cations and anions.

What about for gases? When temperature goes down, solubility goes up. Gases want to raise up and
liquids keep the gas atoms trapped. By adding kinetic energy, you're freeing up the gas atoms to
escape.

Pressure is also a factor. When the atmospheric pressure is high, it pushes the gas molecules down
into the liquid. So when pressure goes up, solubility also goes up.

# Boiling Point Elevation and Freezing Point Supression

For H(2)O to enter a frozen solid state, the molecules must enter an organized crystalline
structure. Any kinetic energy would just move the molecules in place. The hydrogen bonds should be
stronger.

If larger molecules were mixed into water, it would take more energy to enter the frozen state
because you'll have to move the larger molecules out of the way first.

Solute particles lowers the freezing point.

Larger molecules tend to block the surface molecules from escaping. There's a lower vapor pressure.
Because of that, it takes more energy for the surface molecules to escape.

Solute particles raises the boiling point.

It's good to think of solute particles as making the solution stick in a liquid form. It takes more
energy to freeze and it takes more energy to boil.

    T(vaporization-delta) = km  // k = constant, m = molality

Given the properties:

1. 1kg of solvent water
2. 2 moles of NaCl solute

How much is the temperature elevation for boiling point?

    T = k * (4 / 1)  // 4 moles because NaCl breaks up into Na and Cl
    T = 0.5 * 4      // k = 0.5 for water
    T = 2 degrees

The change in freezing point is same formula, but the constant k is negative.

# Introduction to Kinetics

If you put Hydrogen and Iodine together, a reaction will occur and a product will be formed. But
it's not magic, something happens for the reaction to occur. The rates of reaction is called
**Kinetics**.

    H(2)(g) + I(2)g = 2HI

In the gaseous state, Hydrogen/Iodine form covalent bonds. H-H and I-I. Iodine has 7 electrons in
its outer shell and Hydrogen has 1. If the Iodine pair collides into the Hydrogen pair with the
right amount of energy, the pairs bond because of I's high electronegativity. This is called an
**activated complex** and is a higher energy state.

From there, it will go into a lower energy state which is H-I and H-I.

The energy at the activated complex is the **activation energy**. If we can put enough energy into
the system, the activated complex is formed before it breaks up into 2HI.

A **catalyst** participates in a chemical reaction but is not consumed by the reaction itself. It
effects the rate of the reaction. If it slows it down, it's an **inhibitor** (negative catalyst) and
if it speeds it up it's a positive catalyst. It could also effect the amount of energy required by
lowering the activation or potential energy.

When we write equations, things seem so simple - like it just happens naturally. In reality, it's
all probability of molecules bumping into each other and forming reactions. For instance, if the
concentration of molecules goes up so does the rate of reaction (more molecules to bump into each
other!)

Increasing temperature will also increase the rate of reaction. Temperature is just the average
kinetic energy. Faster moving molecules means more odds of them colliding and more energy to get
into the activation complex.

If the surface area goes up, so does the reaction rate. Smaller cubes of salt will react faster to
H(2)O than one large cube of salt.

# Reactions in Equilibrium

Reactions may go in both directions. This is represented in an equation with a double arrow:

    aA + bB <--> cC dD

When the rate of molecules going each direction is equal, the reaction is in an equilibrium.

      Normal Energy  vs  Equilibrium Energy            
    |left ____           |left ____ right
    |----     right      |----      ----
    |         -----      |
    |______________      |________________

A sample reaction:

    N(2)(g) + 3H(3)(g) <--> 2NH(3)

Equilibrium reactions have an **equilibrium constant** that's the concentration of each product to
the power of the moles divided by the concentration of the concentrations of the reactants:

            [C]^c * [D]^d
    K(eq) = -------------  // A,B,C,D are molarity or moles per liter
            [A]^a * [B]^b

For the Haber reaction above:

                [NH(3)]^2
    K(eq) = -----------------
            [N(2)] * [H(3)]^3

If K(eq) < 1, the concentration of the reactants are less than the concentration of the products.
That means the reaction favors the backwards direction.

# Heterogenous Equilibrium

Let's look at another equilibrium reaction:

    BF(3)(g) + 3H(2)O(l) <--> 3HF(aq) + H(3)BO(3)(aq)

The equilibrium constant is:

            [HF]^3 * [H(3)BO(3)]
    K(eq) = --------------------
            [BF(3)] * [H(2)O]^3

Water is the solvent, it's everywhere. So the probability of 3 moles of water being present for 1
mole of BF(3) is practically 100%.

    Rate(forward-reaction) = K(f) * [BF(3)]

Any equilibrium where you have different states of matter is called a **Heterogenous Equilibrium**.
Let's try another one:

    H(2)O(g) + C(s) <--> H(2)(g) + CO(g)

What's the forward rate dependent on? Well, the Carbon is in a solid state. It will be surrounded by
water vapor. There will always be Carbon available on the surface area of the solid. It's dependent
on the water vapor.

    Rate(forward-reaction) = K(f) * [H(2)O]

When you're trying to figure out the equilibrium constant or rates of reaction, for heterogeneous
equilibriums, you should ignore:

* the solvent
* solid state molecules

# Le Chatelier's Principle

    A + B <--> C + D

Sal reminds us just because the rates are the same doesn't mean the concentrations are the same. The
reactant/product concentrations could be higher, but they're constant since the rate is equal.

What happens if we add more A to the system?

The odds are slightly higher that A and B will collide, so the forward rate will increase a bit. The
B's will go down because more will be consumed. The C's and D's will increase in concentration. More
C's and D's will increase the backwards rate - creating a new equilibrium.

What if we add more A and B? It would drive a lot more C's and D's.

What happens if we add more C to the system? The exact opposite.

This is called **Le Chatelier's Principle**. When you stress a reaction, it will favor whatever
relieves the stress.

# Introduction to pH, pOH, and pKw

From Wikipedia: Autoionization is a process by which atoms or molecules spontaneously emit one of
the shell electrons, thus going from a state with charge Z to a state with charge Z + 1, for example
from an electrically neutral state to a singly ionized state.

When H(2)O molecules are placed next to each other, hydrogen bonds usually form. Under some
circumstances - if there's enough kinetic energy - one hydrogen atom may fall of and attach itself
to a different oxygen atom to get:

    2H(2)O <--> H(3)O + OH  // OH = hydroxide

This is called **Autoionization**. It's in equilibrium, so the molecules may bump into each other
again and turn back into water.

Another example is:

    H(2)O <--> H + OH // big picture

The formula above is the big picture, but does not actually happen. Hydrogens don't exist on their
own in water.

           [H^+] * [OH^-]   [H^+] * [OH^-]
    K(w) = -------------- = --------------
              [H(2)O]             1

    K(w) = 10^-7 * 10^-7 = 10^-14

But chemists don't like working with negative powers, so they use negative logs:

    -log(k(w)) = 14
    pKw = 14

In chemistry, the letter p is used to mean negative log.

    [H^+] = 10^-7 M
    pH = -log(10^-7) = 7

Remember, concentration is just moles per liter. In this case, the concentration of Hydrogen in
water is 10^-7 moles per liter.

    pOH = -log(10^-7) = 7

Next, we'll cover acids/bases. An **acid** is just something that increases the hydrogen
concentration. If the concentration of hydrogen goes up, the negative log will go down - so the pH
will go down.

# Acid Base Introduction

Quick review, water naturally creates hydroxide in an equilibrium:

    2H(2)O <--> H(3)O + OH
    H(2)O <--> H + OH

People really care about the concentration of hydrogen ions. This is labeled pH in a lot of
products. At 25C, the pH of water is normally 7.

Remember Le Chatelier's principle. If we stress one side with more hydrogen, it'll effect the
equilibrium. The concentration of hydrogen matters.

**Acids** increase the hydrogen concentration when you place it in water. **Bases** increase the
hydroxide concentration when you place it in water. The full label is actually **Arrhenius Acid**
and **Arrhenius Base**.

Let's look at hydrochloric acid being placed into water:

    HCl(aq) -> H^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq)
    HCl + H(2)O -> H(3)O + Cl

Acids which completely disassociate in water are called **Strong Acids**, it's a one way reaction.
Some examples:

* HCl => Hydrochloric Acid
* HBr => Hydrogen Bromide
* HI => Hydrogen Iodide
* HNO(3) => Nitric Acid
* H(2)SO(4) => Sulfuric Acid

**Strong Bases** are usually anything in group 1 (alkali metals):

    LiOH(aq) -> OH^-(aq) + Li^+(aq)
    LiOH + 2H(2)O -> H(3)O + 2OH + Li
    NaOH(aq) -> OH^-(aq) + Na^+(aq)

There are also **Bronsted-Lowry acid/bases** is a superset. In this definition, an acid is a proton
donor and a base is a proton acceptor.

Arrhenius is always dealing with aqeous water. Bronsted-Lowry does not.

There are also **Lewis acid/bases**. Lewis cares about electrons, an acid is an electron acceptor
and a base is an electron donor.

# pH, pOH of Strong Acids and Bases

Remember, the equilibrium constant of water is just the concentration of hydrogen plus the
concentration of hydroxide:

     K(w) = [H] * [OH]
    p(Kw) = -log([H] * [OH])
    p(Kw) = -log([H]) + -log([OH])
    p(Kw) = pH + pOH

For water at 25C:

    p(Kw) = pH + pOH
       14 = 7  + 7

What happens if you throw 1 molar of hydrochloric acid in water?

    HCl(aq) -> H^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq)
    1 molar = 1 mole/liter of solution
    [H^+] = 1M
    pH = -log(1) = 0

So we know:

    pH of water = 7 is neutral
    pH of HCl(aq) = 0
    pOH of HCl(aq) = 14 - 0 = 14

Let's figure out the pH of a base:

    KOH(aq) -> K^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)
    1 molar = 1 mole/liter of solution
    [OH^-] = 1M
    pOH = -log(1) = 0

So we know for strong bases:

    pOH of KOH(aq) = 0
    pH of KOH(aq) = 14

# pH of a Weak Acid

Weak acids don't disassociate completely.

    HF(aq) <--> H^+(aq) + F(aq)

Why is HCl a strong acid and HF a weak acid? The bond between hydrogen and fluorine is must stronger
than the HCl bond due to fluorine's electronegativity.

             [H^+][F^-]
    K(aHF) = ---------- = 7 * 10^-4
                [HF]

What's the pH of 1.5M of HF?

    1.5M of HF(aq) - x = x moles of H + x moles of F
    x is the concentration that's disassociated
    K(aHF) = 7 * 10^-4 = (x*x)/(1.5x)
    Solve for x, which is the concentration of hydrogen
    pH = -log(.032) = 1.49

# pH of a Weak Base

Let's look at the weak base NH(3) - ammonia is a weak base because it accepts hydrogen protons.

    NH(3)(aq) + H(2)O(aq) <--> NH(4)^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)

What's the pH of .2M of NH(3)? Given pK(b) = -log(Kb) = 4.75

    K(b) = 10^-4.75 = 1.8*10^-5
            x * x    // x is the concentration of NH(4) and OH
    K(b) = -------  
           .2 - x    // .2 - x is the concentration of NH(3)
    x = .001883
    pOH = -log(.001883) = 2.72
    pk(w) = pOH + pH = 14
    pH = 14 - 2.72 = 11.28
