# Copy Hackers, Books 1-4

Joanna Wiebe writes this concise series on how to write copy for the web. Each book is short and
includes tips/instructions.

# 1: Where Stellar Messages Come From

## Messaging Strategy and Know Your Customers

You need to have a clear grasp on your message about:

* your company
* your product, service, or solution

Some principles to follow include:

* some visitors want to read a lot, some want to read a little
* support with social proof
* if you say something - prove it
* clarity > cleverness
* all visitors can be persuaded

Know your customers before you write a word. Know:

* what you want to say
* how to say what you want
* what visitors want to see and how they want to see it

You can figure this out by:

1. Researching your visitors
2. Find out who your target market is (surveys, talk to people)
3. Narrowing market into focusable segments
4. Uncover and address that segment's pain (what do they search for, test PPC)
5. Align everything you say to address the pain

## Write Copy for 20-35% of Visitors, Not 100% of Them

**Focus on niches**, it's easier to convert. Examples:

* CampaignMonitor - Email marketing software for designers and their clients
* CollegeBudget - Student-only deals, delivered daily
* Reachly - We connect hotels with guests in real time

## Document Your Features/Benefits

Address what your user wants first, follow up with how your product satisfies those wants (aka
benefit first, feature second). Example:

Feature - light switch on a lamp. Benefit - You can easily fill a room with light.

Wiebe suggests we document all of our features in a table with 5 columns: features, unique to us,
customer pain solved, benefits, priority. In your copy, turn features into benefits.

Be specific about your benefits/features. Summaries aren't noticeable or memorable. They work in
pairs, always support a benefit with a feature and vice versa.

Show, don't tell.

## Let Customers/Competitors Craft Your Message

* Use keywords your visitors want to see (keyword research tools)
* Do a competitor content audit to understand existing messages (focus on value propositions,
  benefits highlighted, primary call to actions)

## Always Have a Simple Messaging Hierarchy

* Write scannable copy that draws people in
* Make sure the hierarchy is clearly organized, drawing visitors to CTAs

## 8 Messaging Tips

1. Start with 10x more info, write... and then cut
2. Don't assume your audience knows everything
3. Keep offers simple (succinct and sharp sells)
4. Copy works best when readers believe it
5. Customers want a magic button to press
6. If it's current news and related to you, use it
7. Most important decision is how to position your product/service
8. When writing feels difficult, you're doing it right

# 2: Formatting and The Essentials of Web Writing

## Format Copy to Be Scanned

* Be thoughtful, deliberate, intentional with formatting
* Use the "F Pattern"
* Put things out of place when they need to be recognized

## Biggest/Crippling Web Writing Myths

Some myths:

1. Headline should be 7 words or fewer (be succinct but powerful)
2. Always leading with a benefit
3. Don't write "click here" - a/b test it
4. Never say "we"
5. Writing should be done for SEO first
6. Don't begin sentences with "and", "but", or "because"
7. Keeping important copy above the fold

Some facts:

1. Headline is the most important copy on the page
2. Images sometimes speak louder than words
3. Copy is king on the web
4. Write for a 6th grader
5. Use lists and short paragraphs
6. Use the active voice, not the passive ("starvation causes death" not "death is caused by
   starvation")

# 3: Headlines, Subheads, and Value Propositions

## Why Headlines Are Important

* Headline is the most important copy on the page
* Its job is to stop visitors in their tracks

Write the headline before anything else. It must:

* match visitor expectation
* intrigue the visitor
* communicate clearly
* get to the visitor's point

Pair the headline with a subhead. Headline draws visitor in, subhead holds their attention, builds
on headline, and compels them to continue.

**Do not just match your headline to the generic navigation link, like "Features" or "How it
Works".**

## Attention Grabbing Headlines

1. Make an almost unbelievable promise or claim that you can back up
2. Give a time limit - "How to build memory in 4 short weeks"
3. Stomp just 1 objection to smithereens (most common or curious) - "Is this the world's easiest
   yoga?"
4. Be unexpected - "Doing taxes is easier than ever"
5. Tap into something powerfully emotional - "Why models stay young till sixty!"
6. Use trigger words: instantly, worth, one and only, while you sleep, #1, the reason, feel, yes you
   really can.

## Formulas To Write Headlines That Get Read

**OR ELSE PROMISE** Highly desirable thing + time limit + consequence of not being delivered: "Your
dream house blueprints in 7 days or they're free"

**OBJECTION STOMPER** Now + highly desirable thing + even if objection: "Now you can build an iPhone
app even if you're not a programmer"

**HOW TO** How to + verb/noun + benefit: "How to support customers 7x faster with Gizmojo"

**QUANTITIES** Numeral + noun(s) + verb + object OR verb + numeral + noun: "Get 1,000+ New Twitter
Followers"

**LISTS** Numeral + pronoun? + noun + problem: "7 signs you're trapped in a contract"

**WHY, WHEN, OR HOW** Why/when/how + statement of great intrigue: "Why SEO is no longer a mystery"

**NO HOLDS BARRED** The + adjective + way + desirable but difficult thing: "The lightning fast, easy
way to run a free background check"

**SIMILE** Do X + like + Y: "Save money like scrooge"

## Subheads

Two types of subheads: supporting text below a headline and small headlines introducing sections
later in the page.

To support headlines:

* expand on benefit or intrigue
* introduce secondary benefit
* clarify the claim in headline

To use as smaller headlines:

* use to introduce transition to a different point
* be short, clear, benefit focused

## Quick Headline/Subhead Power Tips

* always be clear
* target pain
* don't be tentative, test it out with A/B testing
* think twice about punctuating headlines
* don't over-promise
* consistently capitalize
* try using questions but don't go overboard
* don't be too on the nose when using numbers
* use number 7 instead of word seven
* mirror language from previous CTA

## Value Proposition

* value prop is most important headline
* describe what makes it unique and highly desirable
* highlight benefits/values you're offering
* use whatever applies only to your brand or product
* state in single, succinct, meaningful and clear statement
* be memorable

# 4: Buttons and Click Worthy Calls to Action

## Good Call To Actions

Three levels of CTAs on a page:

1. Primary CTA (generally should be a button)
2. Secondary CTA (button or link)
3. Other/Subordinate CTA (generally should be links)

Two types of buttons:

1. Single-line buttons
2. Multi-line buttons: 2nd lien boosts with supporting point to compel clicks

Principles of high performing button copy:

1. Lead with a familiar verb
2. Use articles or prepositions (eg "the", "a", or "for")
3. Be specific with word choice
4. Add a benefit or point of value if possible
5. Consider page you're driving them to, consider its headline (transition well)
6. Suggest instant gratification (tack on "Today", "Now", "Instantly", or "In Seconds")

A good general example: **Sign Up for Free**

A better specific example: **Get Your Feed Now**

**A/B test your CTA copy**!

## Use This Copy For Your Own Buttons

Copy for buttons fall into five categories:

1. Transactional: add to cart, available in the app store, buy now, buy now & save, buy now and save
   $5, buy now with 1 click, download now, download it free, download the free trial, get instance
   access now, get started, try it free
2. Informational: browser our store, email joe the sales guy, find out more, get details, learn
   more, see pricing, visit our store, watch the demo
3. Sign up: create my account, get notified, get started, sign me up, sign up, sign up for free,
   notify me when you're live
4. Social: add your comment, comment now, follow us on twitter, get the rss feed, join the
   discussion, sign up for the newsletter
5. Corporate (company, including about, hiring, contact, and PR)

For multi-line buttons, here's what to include on the second line:

* quantified discounts
* offer end dates
* length of time to complete action
* money back guarantees
* free shipping
* cancellation policies
* trial time frame
* file size of download

## Stomp Down Objections First

Top 8 common sales objections:

1. Don't really need this
2. Don't have authority to buy
3. Don't want to be sold this
4. Not a high priority
5. Existing solution works well enough
6. Your company doesn't have capability or credibility
7. Your prices are unreasonable
8. I will have to spend too much time/energy convincing others

Address these issues before the CTA.
